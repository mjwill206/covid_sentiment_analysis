CoronavirusNH,exiledbaystater,How can I give constructive feedback on the hospital survey?," I made a mistake. I called my local DHMC-affiliated clinic with a sore throat and fever. They arranged a COVID test for the next day.

A couple of hours later I was on the phone with my parents and they were insistent that I get a strep test and not wait for the COVID test to be administered and processed. I had just finished antibiotics for strep.

I called the DHMC and asked about telehealth after hours. They said they didn’t have it but the walk in clinic was still open for another hour. In my haste to get there I didn’t call ahead. I checked in at the desk, keeping distance and wearing a mask. The receptionist knew all my symptoms and directed me to the main waiting area anyway. It was nearly empty.

Nurse comes our, leads me into a deserted corner, and screams at me for leaving home when I have a COVID test processing (I think she mistakenly thought it had already been administered). I said I needed a strep test. She said I should do one or the other, not both. Obviously she wouldn’t be any safer if I just came without having arranged a COVID test for the next day, so maybe I activated some protocol or just made her panic.

When she finished berating me, she led me to a room, then called the phone to have me check my own vital signs. Then an NP called, then came in wearing head-to-toe PPE and did my strep test along with checking lymph nodes and using a stethoscope.

I was strep positive. As I put the instruments in the bin to be sanitized, the nurse thanked me and told me she hoped I felt better. Like she was a completely different person.

After a lot of soul-searching, I decided her initial behavior was creepy but she deserves compassion for the situation. Is there a way I can respond to the patient survey that will call attention to the stress nurses are under without getting her in trouble?

If anyone wonders, the COVID test was negative.",1,1594996458,new_hampshire,2020-07-17 08:34:18

It’s in a two level warehouse space and there’s 12 of us with the company who all have our own stations that are 10 ft or more apart, so we’re pretty relaxed with masks. This is all fine.

The problem is now my direct report traveled to the south to one of the states NY wants people to quarantine from when their back and my coworker is not planning on doing that. 

When I brought up my concern to the owner who said I was welcome to wear a mask. I pointed out that the coworker is supposed to quarantine and at the very least she should also wear a mask, which the owner said she ask the coworker to do but it still feels really stressful and full of anxiety.

I ask know I need to now quarantine but I’m unclear on if for two weeks or four weeks (if she’s asymptotic she needs to clear the two weeks, then I also need to clear two weeks after that?)

Anyway - I don’t really know what to do about any of this. I like the job but I don’t understand how my employer is comfortable with this situation either and we discussed it a second time I was asked if I was specifically at risk which seems besides the point, and also it was pointed out that I haven’t worn a mask and my response was that everyone being in NY and local is different than someone having traveled to a state with high case numbers and touting that they don’t care about social distancing or other precautions.

That being said, what if a 19 year old asymptomatic case, is NOT wearing a mask, and stands in line at a grocery store next to a 74 year old. Lets me just come out and say it, the 74 year old has just shy of a 41% chance of survival if they contract this virus... mortality rate in that age group is 59% according to current CDC information.

Now, if that 74 year old contracts this virus, and goes to the hospital to get medical attention and then passes, the 19 year old may not have been the one to kill that person, but they were aiding the pathogen in killing a fellow human being.

Going back to my original statement, the sheriff said he wants to stop people from killing each other, and he does, however if he will let a pathogen be easily spread to an elderly person, and kill them, that is not protecting and serving your community, there are too many sheriff's out there that say they aren't the ""mask police"" but probably an unpopular opinion coming from me, ALL of them should be removed from their positions and replaced ( temporarily at least ) with someone more competent  in allocating the resources required to enforce mask wearing, and protect their community which is... after all, their job...

One last side note, if any local governments or the state government could create a task force designed to respond to these 911 calls about people not wearing masks, then this would not be a problem with the police anymore... We have every day people, like you and I, confronting people in stores without a mask, I'm sure we have all seen at least one video of someone telling another person to wear a mask, or leave... I think it is awesome that we have people doing this, and we have people with enough courage to step up for us all. However, I don't think it should ALL be left up to the average every day Joe to enforce a state mandate, I think it is up to the community, companies, and stores, the police, and the state it's self to enforce these mandates and protect us all!",1,1594259690,new_york,2020-07-08 19:54:50

CoronavirusNewYork,DirtMeat_Supreme,"Family is having a party this weekend, am I crazy for not wanting to go?","I live right up the street from the house where this party will be taking place, and a bunch of my family members will be traveling here, some from out of state. We have ~1500+ cases in the county so it could be worse, but the possibility that someone could pick it up on the way here freaks me out. The virus is definitely floating around, there have been exposures at many grocery stores and restaurants in my town and a few friends of mine already know someone that has or has had it.

The owner of the house has demonstrated he doesn’t give a shit about safety precautions, literally getting close enough to feel his breath on my eyeballs while helping with household chores. My family are drinkers too, so I don’t want to bank on the fact that 1) they’re already taking this seriously, and 2) they will try to practice social distancing, wearing masks and whatnot while drunk. In addition to getting drunk, we always have dinner around the table. Oh, and this party is supposed to be outdoors, but the forecast predicts thunderstorms all weekend! 

All of these factors lead me to believe I would be way too anxious to enjoy myself if I tried to attend this party. I feel bad for not wanting to go since people are traveling here and I live so close, but seriously - I feel like a LUNATIC for being the only one to think having a party right now is not a good idea. I’m just trusting my gut, but I want other opinions.

It’s mind boggling how quickly the public attitude towards this virus has gone from direly serious to casual.",1,1594337474,new_york,2020-07-09 17:31:14

&amp;#x200B;

I got tested on 7/7 after  (what I thought was going to be) a socially distanced 4th of July bbq. I got a call from the county DOH saying I tested positive on 7/10, and we began the contact tracing process. I was really actually surprised, because at that point I felt great. My partner and I began isolating in our apartment, and we scheduled a test for him on 7/13. We've proceeded to have no real symptoms (a cough here or there, some loose stool, but nothing that would otherwise be out of the ordinary) and my partner tested negative. We asked our doctor, and she said it is likely that he already picked it up (he works at a grocery store) and had beat the infection by the time of testing. Everyone else I'm close with has also tested negative.

&amp;#x200B;

I received my official results from the lab which said ""presumptive positive"" so I called my doctor's office to confirm what that meant. My doctor said that presumptive positive is a positive result that is conducted at the state or local level, and should be treated as a confirmed positive. She said previously, presumptive positives would have been sent out to the CDC and would then be ""confirmed,"" however the CDC doesn't seem to be doing this these days.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I woke up to this text from NYS DOH:

We have received your test results, (my initials) with a DOB of (my DOB) and it is Negative. If you begin to experience symptoms, such as cough, fever and runny nose, please contact your health care provider. For more information go the DOH website [ny.gov/coronavirus](https://ny.gov/coronavirus)

&amp;#x200B;

I've called everyone I can think of to confirm what this means, and basically everyone has said, ""That's not my job, you should call so and so."" I've tried my county DOH, NYS DOH, the lab which tested me, my doctor's office, and now I'm here. The lab said it's possible they could have been sent elsewhere, but I should contact NYS to know for sure. NYS said they have no results and I should contact my county. My county said they have no results and I should contact the lab where I got my results, and that if my results say presumptive positive, then that's their only answer for me.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems odd to me that they would send this text ten days after my test, but I am wondering if my lab samples were sent elsewhere and tested again? Anyone else get their results this way?",1,1595003159,new_york,2020-07-17 10:25:59

CoronavirusNewYork,NtsBase,"Returning to school, Discussion Board","Hey everyone, so I just wanted to make a place where everyone can share their ideas about what they would like to see if we do reopen in person schooling this fall...

For example I just read a comment on another post about schools taking temps at the door and what they student would do, sit in the office waiting for a parent, take the bus home again? What would the school do if a student came to school with a fever...

My idea was, since some school buses have an aditional staff member, or bus assistant, what if we had an assistant on each bus, that could sit up front and take the temp of students before they even get on the bus to help lower chance of exposure to other kids...

That being said, there are also kids that get dropped off to school, or drive themselves in high school, so I am also proposing 2 separate drop off areas, one for students who have already had their temperature checked before getting on the bus, and a second one for those who get dropped off or drive themselves, this way if anyone has a fever they would have had minimal contact with any other student or staff members.

All of this is just an idea I had on break at work... And it would not solve the issue of asymptomatic students spreading the virus in school, but it would help filter out some of the sick students before having contact with healthy students and staff.

I also would love to see Cuomo announce that schools must have HEPA filters, just like malls must have in order to reopen, this would help to filter out the viral particles in the air and hopefully reduce the likelihood of covid-19 transmission in schools.

I would love to hear some of your ideas on what you would like to see before and if schools reopen this fall.",0,1595200918,new_york,2020-07-19 17:21:58

CoronavirusNewYork,hopes2dreams,Covid and living in a one bedroom family of 4.,"Hey everyone, 

I’m 24, I have a stable job I make about 3k a month after taxes. I’ve been living at home in cramp living conditions to pay down student loan debt. I live in NYC where rent on my own would be a bit more than half my take home pay. Before covid happened I wanted to move out and find a place with 2 roommates so I can have my own room. My sister is going off to college next month, and I would be the primary one sleeping in the bedroom along with my mom who works nights so she’s sleeps in the room one day a week. My dad sleeps on the couch. 

Social distancing these last few months at home hasn’t been well. I’ve been working from home and my parents are both essential workers. They both work long and odd shifts so they aren’t home as much. But once someone gets a cough almost immediately the whole house is sick and it keeps circulating back. Currently we all have a dry cough that’s been here for months. And I’ve been scared to go since there’s no way to socially distance at home. Experts say covid is supposed to make a return in the fall and I would still like to be able to visit my family. I’m not sure of my living options. I have a great relationship with my family but they aren’t move even though I offered to help with rent to get a bigger place. I’m stuck with my options If I should continue to live at home, get roommates who may or may not socially distance but Atleast I’ll have my own room, I’m also open to relocating somewhere near nyc.",2,1595262252,new_york,2020-07-20 10:24:12

CoronavirusNewYork,Jelfff,(1) Interactive COVID-19 map showing recent trends per county and (2) downloadable csv files with case and death counts per day for each county starting March 24,"As a public service I produce an interactive map that uses COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University to tell at a glance whether the number of new cases or deaths in each county is trending up or trending down.  The information for the map is updated each night.

The symbols on the map summarize the recent trends as follows:

Circle		Prior 14 days

Triangle	        Prior 7 days

Green		Good - numbers are trending down

Red		Bad - numbers are trending up

Click any symbol for details.

Open the map and show data about new cases:

The map has a number of overlays that you can turn on/off.  You can display data about recent cases or recent deaths.  The data can be displayed by county, by state or by country.

If you need help using the map, please read the **“Map tips”** (link in upper left corner).

The data that Johns Hopkins is curating is a cumulative count of cases and deaths for all counties in the USA.  You can find that data on their GitHub page at:

[https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

I wrote code that **converts the Johns Hopkins timeseries \*cumulative\* counts into \*daily\* counts of cases and deaths for all counties**.  These daily counts begin March 24th and are in csv files that anyone can download and import into GIS or spreadsheet software.  I made a PDF with details about (1) the interactive map and (2) these csv files.

CoronavirusNewYork,OpinionThrowway,Unpopular opinion: the mask mandates should be extended beyond COVID,"Throwaway because if I posted this from my main account people I know IRL might identify it as mine and I'd like to be able to continue shitposting on that account without people I know seeing and judging.

The mask mandates should be extended even beyond COVID. I live in Rockland and I've been wearing a mask almost every time I go out for the last few years now. People thought it was a little weird but seemed understanding when they asked me about it.  Anyway, I did (and do) this A) because I read the flu could be transmitted asymptomatically and B) for my own protection against infection. I consulted my GP before doing this and there have been no adverse effects on my lungs. I'm not saying people should wear a mask when they go out to eat or anything ridiculous, there need to be some concessions made for quality of life, but if you're going to a concert, a baseball game, an AA meeting? Wear the fucking mask. You already own it now, so why not? Going around flinging spit at people was never a good or hygienic way to behave, pandemic or no. I emphatically *am not* comparing COVID to the flu, but we have to acknowledge that the flu kills tens of thousands of people yearly and those deaths *are preventable* and always have been. I know my suggestion about mandating this probably won't come to pass--frankly I was pleasantly surprised as many people complied with the mask mandates as they did--but you can make a difference even once this is over.

CoronavirusNewYork,NtsBase,"School are dangerous to reopen... *rant* (Lengthy post, feel free to pass over)","*Warning* This post was originally intended to be about how kids wear their masks around their necks at grocery stores instead of actually having them on, this is the first half, after that is where it turned into more of a rant about how this just isn't safe at all...

Now, I want schools to reopen, but I also want them to have an actual plan first, and as of right now... It seems like our plans aren't working... (This was added post writing of everything, figured I should add it for good measure)

The actual post will start right below...




So, I work at a grocery store, and all the time I see kids with masks around their necks, maybe one out of 15 kids actually have it on their face...

Is this just parents not caring, or can they genuinely not make their kid wear a mask...

If they genuinely can't get their kid to keep a mask on for half an hour, how are teachers going to make a kid keep their mask on for 6+ hours? One teacher I saw said they would bring kids outside for mask breaks, but how long will that break last, 5 minutes? And how often would they be, once every hour or two?

So again, of parents can't get their kids to keep a mask on in a grocery store for half an hour, how are teachers going to make kids keep their mask on for hours on end?

Keep in mind I'm talking about k-8th I do believe high schoolers will be more likely to wear a mask, plus punishment for not wearing a mask would be much more viable in high schools than elementary... Middle school is a bit more tough because you have the students that are mature enough to understand the situation, and then you have the students who act like 2nd graders yet their in middle school...

Plus what should the punishment even be for not wearing a mask? You can't send them to detention with 15 other kids not wearing masks... If you suspend them it's basically going to just be, here's your work figure it out yourself... Or ittle just be online for them, and you really shouldn't expell a kid for not wearing a mask, it seems too extreme...

Not to mention that I just saw an article about a school that opened in Indiana, had a student test positive, ON THE FIRST DAY OF REOPENING! (They were there for HOURS in multiple classrooms having contact with different students and staff)

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/us/schools-reopening-indiana-coronavirus.amp.html

The scariest article I read was about a town in Northern Georgia, said MASKS ARE OPTIONAL!!!

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/schools-in-bucolic-north-georgia-town-opened-friday-masks-optional/ZD4E2K44HNBWPIK2QWGGG4F5BM/%3foutputType=amp

This is honestly going to be a disaster without the proper planning, and help from the federal government which basically has said this entire time that the CDC's guidelines are just that, guidelines, not mandatory... We need an actual solid plan, we need a way to keep students safe, if I were a parent I would be horrified to send my child to any school right now based off of how things are turning out so far... I'd be concerned for everyone, not even just a kid that goes to school, I'd be concerned for teachers, parents, any extended family...

I understand that we need school, and I WANT them to reopen! But we need to do it the right way! And what we're doing now, this is NOT the right way!

(Feel free to check any of this information for yourself, I'm sure you'll find more articles about different places giving many examples of how it just isn't safe...)",1,1596342672,new_york,2020-08-01 22:31:12

Today marks the second half of 2020. 

Today's 129 new positives represent 2.2% of the 5979 new tests. In these more recent days, the 2% range has been a good news indicator for me. For perspective, states like Florida are seeing 15% of new tests coming back positive. It's seems like we are maintaining when our percent is below 2%, but I am not an epidemic professional just an observer.

500 New Mexicans have died from covid 19, with 3 additional deaths reported today. RIP to those 500 people, and heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and communities of those 500 people. 

The number of hospitalizations is the same number are yesterday - 127 people are currently in the 7 hub hospitals ICU beds. For perspective, my understanding is that there are 465 (or so) such beds available within our state. 

The number of recovered is now 5514, which means 6262 people remain positive.

Highlights:

the governor announced that the state will aggressively enforce the mandatory face-covering requirement for all residents in public places. In accordance with state law, violators will be subject to a $100 fine. In addition, retailers will now be required to ensure that their customers are wearing face coverings in order to enter store premises. 

COVID-19 cases are rising precipitously in neighboring states and indeed across the U.S. Therefore the governor today announced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all out-of-state travelers into New Mexico, whether traveling by air or by vehicle. Hotels and other places of lodging are expected to enforce the 14-day travel quarantine for any out-of-state visitors and report non-compliance to state health authorities.

State officials expressed concern about rising positivity among younger cohorts of New Mexicans. This week the largest group of news cases is among individuals in the 20-to-29-year-old age group (27 percent of new cases), according to the Department of Health, and over the past seven days, the second-highest group of new cases is among individuals from age 30-to-39 (19.9 percent of new cases).",1,1593646655,new_mexico,2020-07-01 17:37:35

Today's 256 positives represents 3.8% of the 6737 new tests. I have mentioned before I am much more comfortable when that percent is in the 2% range. 256 represents another second daily high number for New Mexico: June 5th we had 319, today we have 256, yesterday we had 244 new positives. This represents a daily increase of approximately 100 people per day from our  average daily number in the month of June (which was 149 per day).

511 New Mexicans have died from covid 19, including 8 additional people reported today. June's daily number of deaths was on average below 5, so of course it is disheartening to see that number increase. RIP to all those people and heartfelt condolences to the many families, friends and communities experiencing those losses.

Hub hospital ICU hospitalizations is at 130 people, which is an increase of 3 from yesterday. Again, the total number  of such ICU beds is about 465 (if I recall correctly), and I am happy to see the number well below our previous numbers in the 200s.

[FULL ARTICLE can be found here.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/coronavirusfrontlines/2020/07/03/an-infectious-disease-doctor-explains-why-coronavirus-cases-are-skyrocketing/#77a74e253ed6)

“High risk activities involve being around others. Risk increases when engaging in indoor activities, and the more people, the more time, and the more crowded an area translates to more risk. Not wearing a mask is riskier than wearing one.

Lower risk activities involve being by yourself, being outdoors, social distancing, and limiting the number of people with whom you have direct contact. Wear a mask when you can’t avoid being in close proximity to others.

Sadly, by ignoring the problem, the chance of our getting back to “normal” gets further and further away, and the outcomes we are trying to avoid (economic damage, illnesses and deaths, limited travel, loss of psychological well-being and social interactions), will continue longer than necessary. We are already seeing the consequences of rising cases in the inability of Americans to travel to Europe. This will only get worse until we get this virus under control, which will require us to attack the problem proactively, not continue to play catch up.

Today's 220 new positives represents 4.4% of the 5002 new tests. Today is our second day of 4% range positive testing after almost the whole month of June in the 2% or 3% range. Two days is not a solid indication of an increase in that metric, but it does seem to be tending higher. For perspective, Florida had a 17% positive rate recently.

519 New Mexicans have died from covid 19, with 4 deaths reported today. RIP to those people. Condolences to family, friends and communities of these people.

The number of people reported in NM's 7 hub hospital ICU beds is 133 people. My understanding is that there are 465 such beds available. We have increased in the last three days from 119 to 129 to 133.

5986 people are currently reported as recovered which means 7222 remain positive.

coronavirusnewmexico,covidthrowaway505,NEED HELP (legal): Quarantine issues with an out-of-state visitor,"I live with my Dad and he has a friend from Colorado who's been staying with us since Friday.  Her reason for coming here is because her elderly father (who lives in NM) had an injury of some sort and is hospitalized.  So she decided to come here and do the 14-day quarantine at our house until she's able to visit him.

Yesterday I found out that she left our house to visit her mother, which is definitely a violation of that health order.  My Dad shrugged it off like it was no big deal, but I've been stressing out about it because she broke the law and we're now roped into her mess by default.

Before she came here, I couldn't find any information as to whether or not my Dad and I would have to quarantine WITH her for 14 days since she's staying in the same house as us.  And I also don't know if she gave any of her information to state police/authorities upon crossing the CO-NM border.

So basically, my question is this:  If she's being tracked by authorities and they find out she left our house during her quarantine (or that my Dad and I didn't quarantine with her), are we going to be subject to fines and penalties?  I just couldn't find any information about having an out-of-state visitor quarantine at a NM residents house.  But now this whole situation feels like we're harboring a fugitive, and I just want to do the right thing and not break any laws since I can't afford to deal with any of that right now.",7,1595354252,new_mexico,2020-07-21 11:57:32

It's our first day of a double digit loss since June 11th, which had been our only double digit day of loss in June. May saw seven days with double digit losses.

There are currently **154** people in the '7 hub hospital ICU beds'. It is my understanding that NM has 465 of these beds. This number is the same number as  yesterday, with a nonincreasing trend lasting a week. As I have mentioned, I really don't know what this metric means, but our highs were in the 200s... up to 230.

*\[If anyone has more detailed information about what this metric actually represents, that would be helpful. Right now, I look at it as a relative value, with 465 being the max and the 210s range being the number at our earlier peak in late May.\]*

**6870** people are listed as recovered which means **10,059** remain positive.

The percent of patients per number of positives - that number has been approximately 2% since June 25th and is equal to **1.5%** today. This percent has been decreasing for nine days. In our earlier 'peak' times, this metric was higher and in the 3% to 6% ranges.

Statewide R-effective has decreased to 1.0.

The Northeast and Metro regions continue to have increasing daily case counts.

The 20-29 and 30-39 year old age groups continue to make up 
the highest percentages of total cases (excludes out-of-state, federal and state detention and correctional facilities)

Since the beginning of June, there has been an increase in Hispanic or Latino cases and decline in American Indian or Alaska Native cases in the 20-29 year old and 30-39 year old age groups

Hospitalizations have increased since early July. Ventilator use has decreased and is currently at 22%

The 55-64 year old age group makes up the highest percentage of hospitalizations. There has not been much change in hospitalizations in 
each age group from week-to-week.

Hospitalizations are declining in the NW Regions, but increasing in the Metro, SW, SE, and NE Regions

COVID-19 deaths have been decreasing since May. Deaths may begin to increase due to the recent spikes in cases across New Mexico

Case fatality rates (CFR) across regions have slightly decreased since last week. 

The 75-84 and 85+ age groups continue to have the highest CFRs (21% and 39% respectively)


• Social distancing: Cell phone data suggests the rise in mobility of New Mexico 
residents may be slowing down. 

• Contact tracing: The median time to quarantine for contacts identified last 
week was 4.5 days.

CoronaNC,JeffJacksonNC,Update: Here's the COVID situation in North Carolina (and some cautionary tales to avoid) - Sen. Jeff Jackson," 

https://preview.redd.it/ya4428rhpu951.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77a89597fc2295545854660a029f4ba90635ba3d

It’s becoming clear that one of the biggest COVID concerns for North Carolina isn’t just what’s happening in our state - it’s the cautionary tales we’re seeing in other states.

In our state, the situation is not good, but it’s not out of control.

Cases are up...

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hm8yr2kipu951.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d553f486a5b1b36057cb969f2e52bac31f238b3b

...but so is testing:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u4q3adajpu951.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4d10fadb1ebb59701f890e83c74c431d2ab6bee

To make sense of both of those metrics and see the overall situation, we look at the percentage of tests that are coming back positive. That controls for the fact that we’ve increased testing.

And that number has remained flat at about 9%:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v1smpa0kpu951.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=720e369db671d99af243df373b15f6cf0b9e1934

What does that mean?

It means the absolute number of cases is going up, but the rate of growth is not. So we have linear growth, but not exponential growth.

To be clear: No one defends having a 9% positive rate. According to Sec. Cohen, she wants to get it down to half that. It’s a bad situation - but the larger point is that it could easily become worse.

We know this just from looking around.

South Carolina is at a 20% positive rate.

Arizona is at 25%.

Florida is at 19%.

That's why their new case charts look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: The COVID Tracking Project](https://preview.redd.it/y548kwxkpu951.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f3278d313caa9bdaa970c8b7fc1b914d6b6c1b0)

To be clear, if we get a chart like that in our state, everything changes.

There are certain reopening conversations we're having right now that will simply stop. And not because of government - because of citizens. If we see this kind of explosive growth in our state, personal and family behavior will dramatically change. And lots of people will needlessly suffer and die.

These are striking cautionary tales that we simply cannot ignore - no matter how tired everyone is of dealing with this.

Which brings up a good question:

**""Hey Jeff - do we have any weapons for fighting this that are more effective than testing, masks, and social distancing?""**

No. We do not. Those are our three most effective weapons. If we drop one, we have a serious problem. We need to fully use all three to keep this from getting out of control.

That's why, when looking at policy options for our state, the issue isn’t just what the situation is right now. The issue is how quickly things could get worse, and we don’t have to speculate about that. All we have to do is look around.

I understand reopening is a huge debate. But we’re in a much, much better position than these others states. They simply don’t have as many options as we do right now.

In order to preserve our options - in order to even *have* a reopening debate - we have to recognize how close we are to finding ourselves in a much worse position and guard against it.

In particular, the debate about wearing masks has become absurd. Please wear one.

This is an enemy that can multiply faster than we can defend and if we pretend otherwise for a few weeks it could easily re-write the whole script.

The good news is we still have the ability to avoid that in North Carolina. We just have to learn from the mistakes of others and make sure we don't repeat them.

July 9 report.

The latest COVID-19 metrics for North Carolina are not good, according to statistics the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services released on Thursday.

Hospitalizations in the state due to the new coronavirus topped 1,000 for the first time on Thursday, at 1,034.

The state also saw a its second-highest single-day increase in confirmed cases to date, with 2,039. This is only the second time the state has had more than 2,000 additional cases confirmed on one day.

While the exact number of new cases per day is artificially affected by lags in reporting and communication between local and state officials, as well as weekly cycles of testing and processing results, it’s undeniable that the trend has been steadily upward in case counts in recent weeks.

Even though some of this is due to additional testing, the numbers of tests completed for Thursday’s count wasn’t as high as many other recent days that had lower numbers of positive results.

Deaths in North Carolina from illness known to be related to the new coronavirus increased by 20 to 1,461.

**July 8, 2020**

After setting an undesirable single-day record for additional confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in North Carolina residents of 2,099 on Friday, the number of additional cases has fallen back in recent days with just 1,346 on Tuesday, but picking up to 1,435 on Wednesday, according to statistics from the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.

These numbers are still well above those seen earlier in the pandemic and the fall off during the course of a week has been typical, with low counts at midweek and high ones Fridays and Saturdays.

A week into July, the state’s total confirmed case count stands at 77,310, with 1,441 deaths of those who tested positive for the infection.

More than a million tests have been completed in the state, but many may be on the same person multiple times, while many people have never been tested for a virus that spreads rapidly and sometimes has few to no symptoms, while at other times can make people horribly sick and lead to death.

Currently, the state reports 994 N.C. residents hospitalized with the illness, the highest level so far.

While the virus is widespread throughout the state, some counties have a much higher number of confirmed cases. There are currently 17 counties with more than 1,200 confirmed cases each, including Mecklenburg with 13,489, Wake with 6,471, Durham with 4,182, Forsyth with 3,450, Guilford with 3,275, Wayne with 1,935, Johnston with 1,825, Duplin with 1,620, Union with 1,579, Gaston with 1,479, Cumberland with 1,440, Robeson with 1,434, Cabarrus with 1,424, Rowan with 1,382, Randolph with 1,353, Alamance with 1,319, and New Hanover with 1,242.

NC had a record high. USA had a record high (2 straight days, 60K plus). Everyone who got sick over July 4th went to get tested. PERIOD. In 2-3 weeks: the USA will see a surge in deaths (right now, 800 people per day).

What else is happening? There are reports NC is spending $$ to finally test congregate living facilities (especially prisons), and high-risk populations (elderly, nursing homes). There are suspicions that people are tested/re-tested in hospitals (counted as multiple cases). And - there are open questions if people who seek to return to work but continue to test-positive daily are being counted as ""new"" cases. (a big problem we will face in a Phase III, Phase IV environment).

We work with the hand that has been dealt to us. Thirty-two counties have recorded over 700 cases.

Jacksonville Christian Academy:  [http://jacksonvillechristianacademy.com/](http://jacksonvillechristianacademy.com/)  

Larry Haggard, administrator of Jacksonville Christian Academy, is having families sign waivers ahead of returning full enrollment - around 250 students - in August. “It’s just an extra precaution,” Haggard said. “It hopefully will remind the parents that they are actually in charge of their students’ instruction, as well as their lives and well-being.” This summer, Haggard said he’s heard from families desiring a return to regular lessons. “I believe about 80% preferred us to go back to as normal as possible, with upgrades in safety,” he said. Jacksonville Christian will conduct temperature checks, hand-washing, and more social distancing, but no mask mandates or limits to in-person instruction. The school will offer lesson recordings for families to access virtually -- though Haggard said no families have requested this yet. While surveys of public school educators have revealed their concerns about returning to school buildings, Haggard said he hasn’t heard any staff members express anxiety about working during the pandemic. “It’s possible our folks don’t see the danger,” he said. “Even teachers with some physical issues are ready to go back.” Asked if he fears a full reopening could help spread the virus, Haggard said, “Sociological and educational experts that I read are saying that schools are a necessary thing.”

If this is the case, what hope does that leave for ever recovering from Covid?

Covid19_Ohio,ButFirst_IcedCoffee,"If you are Covid +, what are the ""rules""?","Let's say that you unfortunately test positive for Covid- are there any actual ""rules"" for what you can and cannot do? I'm not talking about *etiquette*, I'm talking about if you are actually given firm instructions from the ODH or wherever you receive your test results from. I've tried searching the Covid ODH website, and am not having luck with answers.

I ask because I know of an individual who has tested positive who has travelled twice on an airplane after finding out their test results and interacted with their family from other parts of the country without masks (yes, this person was positive at the time of their flights). I am seriously, genuinely concerned about this person's willful disregard for others' health in our community. I have a close family member that works with this individual and their family and I'm afraid for their safety. 

Any thoughts or advice? Just let them ""live their life"" and let it go? Is this something that can be reported somewhere? In general, I am wondering what information (if any) is provided to patients who test positive for the virus and what instructions they are given, and if there are any true regulations.

Even if we give up all doubts that the schools will do everything necessary (which I don't think they will) to keep things clean and safe all kids still have to go home. That is what I worry about.

School does a bang up job but little Johnny goes home to has his parents are are anti maskers hoax believers. Then little Johnny incubates and brings it on to the school with him.

This in reference to pro athletes. He then stated that this needs to continue until the risk is 0%. I will assume he was referring to risk of death as this is ultimately the endpoint we are trying to avoid. Which got me thinking...What is the goal? Is it 0% risk of death. What is an acceptable level of risk of death. When is it acceptable to be sad that deaths occurred, but all things considered, this is acceptable.

Yesterday my neighbor was sitting on his porch steps as I got home from my walk.  Hadn't seen him in quite a while and he yelled a greeting.  I approached him and got about 6 feet from him and he said he wasn't doing too well, swore me to secrecy, and admitted that he had covid, tested on 7/3, confirmed on the 6th.  xray showed bilateral pneumonia.  I realized all at the same time he looked absolutely terrible.  Thinner, no shave, greasy, short of breath, looked exhausted and said the same.  I started backing away from him and he kept talking and talking.  I'd back more steps and he just kept talking until I turned away, not wanting to be rude but starting to realize I had to.  It happened too fast!  Neither of us were wearing masks.  

So, is this contact?  Should I quarantine myself now?  

He swore me to secrecy before he told me what was wrong, but I feel I should tell my husband.  I mean, he lives here too.  What about this secrecy now? 

Told me his next door neighbor on the other side who he hangs out with tested ""false positive"".  What does that mean?",1,1594826338,ohio,2020-07-15 09:18:58

I’m hoping to get some further direction. I work at a midsize office in the downtown Cleveland area.

Covid19_Ohio,cabbage_rolls89,Information for those considering homeschooling this year in Ohio,"Currently, there is a lot of debate on what will happen with school in the fall. Some districts are offering distance learning as an option for some families, and some districts are hoping to come back in person. I think that schools are doing the best they can with what they have to best serve students and faculty, however I understand that many families are uncomfortable with the options that are available. As someone who stumbled through learning and understanding how to homeschool in Ohio several years ago, I wanted to provide a little bit of information for those who are interested. 

Distance or virtual learning offered by your school district is still considered to be enrollment in public school. In my opinion, it is a great option for many families especially if you are planning on returning your child to in person public school in the near future. With distance learning, children are able to keep up with the standards of public school, and are kept in the habit of completing familiar work. 

K-12 is also considered to be enrollment in public school. This can also be a good option for parents/caregivers who want to keep their child up to the standards set by the state of Ohio. For the lower grades however, a child should be accompanied by an adult as they work through their daily lessons.

Traditional homeschool is seperate from public school. The parents/caregivers set the standard, and decide on what they need to teach their children. 

Ohio is a ""notify only state"". That means a parent must only notify their local district of their intent to homeschool, meaning you do not need approval. This is accomplished by sending a NOI (notice of intent) to your districts superintendent office. It is recommended to send this certified mail with return receipt for your own records. You must also send a list of intended curriculum. This is essentially just a list of what resources you intend to use for each subject in your homeschool. You are free to change your curriculum throughout the year as needed, with no further notification to your district. 

At the end of your homeschool year, or if you decide to re-enroll in public school at any point during the year, you will need to provide a portfolio review by a licensed teacher, or have your child complete a standardized test. These options will depend on how you decide to homeschool. Some parents choose to use a public school standard with similar materials, some choose to create or purchase their own curricula. 

That's it. That's all you have to do. I have found that this [website ](https://ohiohomeschoolingparents.com/) has more comprehensive and easy to understand focus on laws, requirements, and specific circumstances for both new and experienced homeschoolers. It also has a [primer](https://ohiohomeschoolingparents.com/the-primer) that explains in detail what steps parents need to take. 

You will find that the homeschool community in Ohio is incredibly diverse and there is space for everyone. Some are religious, some (like us) are secular. Some lean more towards ""unschooling"" and some create very challenging and rigorous curriculums. Some purchase their materials ready made, some piece together workbooks and materials from various resources. 

I hope this helps someone, or at least answers some basic questions for anyone who is as lost as I was when I began to learn about homeschooling in Ohio. Please feel free to ask any questions and I will answer them to the best of my ability.",67,1595313233,ohio,2020-07-21 00:33:53

Covid19_Ohio,petitespantoufles,Restaurant cooks not wearing masks- is this the norm? Is it safe?,"Hello Buckeyes. Here's my situation: I'm planning on picking up some takeout for some family members. Both are immuno compromised (one's taking a biologic, one's got a heart condition) and over 65. They've asked me to pick them up something from one of their favorite local places. Checking out the restaurant info, I found reviews saying because they are a family-operated place, they have decided to not wear masks. I called and asked, talked with one of their teens who was working. They were completely upfront and confirmed they are not wearing them because they believe they are taking precautions and anyways, they all live together. They are doing patio dining only, customers are not inside the restaurant, not even takeout customers.

Here's my questions: I checked the state guidelines on masks, and the language around exemptions for restaurant workers is pretty loosey goosey, it says they don't have to wear masks if it would present a health or safety danger. Any kitchen line worker could claim working around an open flame in a mask is against safety protocol. Curious from anyone in the industry if that's generally what's going on in the back of most restaurants? Would having this family prepare the food be any more risky than having any other restaurant prepare it?

And for anyone, in the industry or not, has there been any recent info on whether transmission by food can occur? The last news I read about it was about a month ago. Just trying to assess whether i'm worrying needlessly. Thanks for your help.",1,1595993856,ohio,2020-07-28 21:37:36

Covid19_Ohio,thedowcast,Hydroxychloroquine - researcher's perspective," Hydroxychloroquine in relation to Chapter 27 of Ares Le Mandat.

US President Trump has advocated for Hydroxychloroquine to be considered as an effective treatment for COVID-19. However, after a number of people have been reported to experience serious adverse side effects, the general consensus has-as a result- turned largely pessimistic about Hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness. The reason I considered the recommendation of a malaria drug as solid reasoning is based on my research in making sense of how overall health is divided mainly into two opposing sides. This is explained in Chapter 27 of Ares Le Mandat. The lineup of symptoms, vitamins, and minerals on one side can each fight against the symptoms, vitamins and minerals of the other side. My reasoning infers that because Vitamin E is designated to side one of health in Chapter 27, while flu is designated to side two, Vitamin E can easily be nominated as a candidate for treatment of anything flu-like(I infer COVID-19 as a flu-like illness). Because its hypothesized that anything on side one can fight against anything on side two, theoretically-as a result of that-any symptom, vitamin or mineral from side one is a contender to fight against any symptom, vitamin or mineral on side two. Judging from the way the components(symptom, vitamin or mineral) of each side is allocated- with high insulin on side one versus both flu and malaria on side two(see pg 533-534 of Chapter 27 of Ares Le Mandat)- Hydroxychloroquine with its high insulin/hypoglycemic side effect becomes a solid proposal in the fight against COVID-19. After reading about the fatal cases pertaining to Hydroxychloroquine use, I learned that the adverse effects mirrored strongly the adverse affects of extreme hypoglycemia and insulin overdose which both normally end in cardiac arrest. This is not the case for all reported treatments of COVID-19 with Hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine has been found effective in some studies. Treatment with Hydroxychloroquine cut the death rate significantly in sick patients hospitalized with COVID-19 – and without heart-related side-effects, according to a new study published by Henry Ford Health System. https://www.henryford.com/news/2020/07/hydro-treatment-study

What Hydroxychloroquine does-in terms of how it applies to the Chapter 27 perspective-is draw from the high insulin component of side one and uses that to fight against the components of side two. Furthermore, it should not be surmised that this infers for a component of one side to be without problems should it be administered beyond what is necessary for treatment. This is happening with use of Hydroxychloroquine in some cases. A good analogy is drinking not just enough water just to satisfy one's thirst, but drinking too much to not only satisfy one's thirst but also go overboard and at the same time bring oneself to water intoxication. In this, one can understand such a scenario doesn't discount water altogether as an effective treatment for thirst. The key for any further research on Hydroxychloroquine would be in understanding the individual patient's initial level of insulin and administering based on that in order to circumvent the dangers of the hypoglycemia/high insulin overdose symptom of Hydroxychloroquine's adverse effects.

Moreover, what Chapter 27 of Ares Le Mandat does is show why there is more than one effective method to fight COVID-19 or any other disease.",1,1596150112,ohio,2020-07-30 17:01:52

Covid19_Ohio,recovering_lurker27,COVID Response Survey Results,"Hello again, everyone, and thank you for helping me with my survey a few weeks ago. For anyone that's interested, here are the results of my survey. I received a total of 1,062 responses from 44 states plus DC, 111 of which were from Ohio. 

Overall, 49% believe the virus needs to be taken more seriously than it is now, 26% say it is not as serious as they were led to believe, 13% say it was portrayed appropriately and 11% say it was totally overblown. In Ohio, 66% said it needs to be taken more seriously, 20% said it was either totally overblown or that it was less serious than they first believed.

55% say that government needs to do more to address the pandemic. 23% say actions taken went too far, 11% say actions were totally unjustified, and 10% say actions so far have been appropriate. In Ohio, 76% said more action is needed, compared to 20% who said actions went too far or were totally unjustified.

The Federal govt's response was widely panned, with 80% either strongly or somewhat disapproving vs 14% somewhat or strongly approving. (87 vs 6.5% in Ohio). State responses were also underwater generally 56%-37%, although Ohioans gave their state higher marks, 60% approving and 35% disapproving. Local/County responses generally had 45% disapprove, 38% approve, with 17% neutral. In Ohio, local responses had 42% disapprove, 33% approve, 24% neutral. It is important to note that this does not differentiate between those dissatisfied because they gov't did not do enough and those dissatisfied because the gov't did too much. 

Overall, about three quarters of respondents said that wearing a mask (75.6%) and social distancing (76.7%) were somewhat or very important (90% and 92% of Ohioans). Similar numbers said that they wear a mask (78.8%) and social distance (76.8%) in public most or all of the time, with the remainder stating that they do them half of the time or less (88% and 93% of Ohioans). 

A correlation test found that, among other things, there is a strong positive relationship between how serious someone viewed the threat of the virus to be and how important they think that masks and distancing are, although the relationship is slightly less strong between that perception and whether or not they actually do those things. A moderate but highly significant relationship was found between having more liberal views and having a negative opinion about the federal government's response, as well as placing more importance on masks and distancing.

If anyone has any questions please let me know! If for some reason anyone would like to take a look at my dataset or R code, please send me a DM. Thank you again for your help in this project!",1,1596212080,ohio,2020-07-31 10:14:40

I have not cheated or misused the Ohio unemployment system. I followed every order given to me by my employer/manager and even the parent company that owns employs us. I would really like my case revisited and reconsidered, as I have been within full compliance of the system.

I have documentation, and files to prove it. I was a full time worker prior to covid and had been employed at my current job since 6/1/2018
I had been receiving benefits since 5/1/20 and my occupation officially closed down 3/16/20

What in the world is happening, now they are telling me this morning I have to pay back over $14,000!?!",1,1596636298,ohio,2020-08-05 08:04:58

CoronavirusOklahoma,Not_Michelle_Obama_,It's basically impossible to get a timely test in OKC.,"I was referred for a test on Wednesday. CVS doesn't test, Walmart is closed, Cleveland and Oklahoma county health departments are booked until Tuesday. OU is booked until Tuesday.

I'm still calling urgent care places to see if they can get me in, but Tuesday means a 6 day waiting time plus the 2-5 business day time to get the results. That's absurd, and there's a chance that I will have recovered by then.

How are the numbers meant to be accurate if the wait time is that long? If our data is two weeks out of date, why would it matter calling the places I've been?

It's been three months since this pandemic began and finding a test site has been a worse experience than the virus itself. Why don't we have a better system in place?",1,1593707582,oklahoma,2020-07-02 10:33:02

His boss told him he can’t call out sick because he’s a manager, and when he told his boss that he was worried about having COVID and wanted to get tested, he was told that if he gets tested, he can’t come back to work. They want him to “suck it up and be the manager we know you can be” and they don’t care if he might have the virus.

Just wanted to let you all know about IMMY labs providing free drive-through testing. They did it today in Norman and MidWest City. I believe they will have more free-days coming up before long. 

I was exposed to a positive case early last week and went today, and I was pretty surprised to see how efficient it all was. Had to wait in line for about 15-20 minutes, but the check in was quick and the test is about 1 minute total, first they explain the test and swab you for about 10 seconds. Then you’re off! The test is quite uncomfortable, but I wouldn’t say it’s painful. Just feels unpleasant but it’s over before you know it. Don’t be scared to get one!

For their free days, all you have to do is sign up for a time slot on their website and provide a name, email, birthday and phone number. No insurance required. 

They told me I will likely have results by tomorrow, but if not then, definitely by Tuesday. I’ll let y’all know if it takes longer. I’m feeling fine so hopefully I’m good.

Cheers, and stay well everyone!",1,1596431588,oklahoma,2020-08-02 23:13:08

CoronavirusOregon,teksquisite,Sick people in January who were diagnosed with the unknown (maybe it was COVID-19),"I think we may have had Coronavirus cases in Oregon as early as mid-January. I had a dog park friend (65) who flew to Washington to visit her military family over the holidays. The first week of January she was extremely ill and could hardly breathe, and could not taste or smell anything. She was diagnosed with the flu and treated. It took her about six weeks to recuperate. 

Another friend (38) took a princess cruise to Mexico around mid-January and her guy friend was super ill with a high fever, difficulty breathing and tested negative for the flu. They did not know why he was so sick. A few days after my friend arrived home—she became super ill (along with her teenage son) and was sick for a few weeks.

The above is just two examples of potential COVID-19 cases that may have gone unnoticed. I’m wondering if it’s been lingering in our backyard since January of 2020?",4,1594231016,oregon,2020-07-08 11:56:56

But since I lost my job in March I have not received I single unemployment check. My claim is accepted, but alas... No payment. I've been scraping by with help from family, and the community but August isn't looking good for me. Anyone that has scraped by knows that it's a slippery slope before you're in way over your head. I know I'm not the only one. Apparently there are at least 4,000 other people like me, and I know they can't be feeling any better about the situation. 

The futility of the fight is immeasurable. According to their website  if you have problems like mine you can either call a number that is always 100% of the time busy (to the point that I am starting to doubt it's even hooked up), or you can basically tweet your issue at them (I've never received a response). It's near impossible to contact the unemployment department.

So I'm guessing if others like myself were able to grab their attention the state would have to put some effort into prioritizing these people. It doesn't even have to be a protest, but a way to garnish enough attention to the cause that forces leaders to make the necessary changes. Taking suggestions...

CoronavirusOregon,ToriCanyons,Can anyone explain policies at Pacific Seafood in Lincoln City?,"Is anyone here familiar with Pacific Seafood and how they have adjusted their workplace?  NY Times mentioned the outbreak in an article claiming that mask use reducing the severity of infections:  


[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/coronavirus-mask-protection.html?utm\_source=pocket-newtab](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/health/coronavirus-mask-protection.html?utm_source=pocket-newtab)

&gt;Some indirect data has been accumulating from people as well.  Researchers have tentatively estimated that about 40 percent of  coronavirus infections [do not produce any symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html). But when some people [wear masks](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/06/big-coronavirus-outbreak-at-newport-seafood-plants-is-contained-health-authorities-say.html), the proportion of asymptomatic cases [seems to skyrocket](https://apnews.com/4b9d38f206db9ce5267a5898ac24f238),  reportedly surpassing 90 percent during one outbreak at a seafood plant  in Oregon. Wearing a face covering doesn’t make people impervious to  infection, but these trends of asymptomatic cases could suggest that  masks lead to milder disease, potentially reducing hospitalizations and  deaths. 

The only evidence is a statement from company HR via an Oregon Live article:

[https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/06/big-coronavirus-outbreak-at-newport-seafood-plants-is-contained-health-authorities-say.html](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/06/big-coronavirus-outbreak-at-newport-seafood-plants-is-contained-health-authorities-say.html)

&gt;But a spokesman for Pacific Seafood said late Monday that the company  took numerous steps to protect the safety of its employees, prior to the  outbreak, including implementing enhanced cleaning measures, providing  workers with face masks and face shields, instituting daily temperature  checks and installing barriers between workstations to ensure social  distancing. 

Is anybody here familiar with operations at Pacific Seafood?  I did find this on a Lincoln County paper dated June 8th.  Here is what the incredibly small comment section said:

[https://yachatsnews.com/pacific-seafood-announces-that-124-workers-at-its-newport-plants-have-tested-positive-for-covid-19-closes-all-five-facilities/](https://yachatsnews.com/pacific-seafood-announces-that-124-workers-at-its-newport-plants-have-tested-positive-for-covid-19-closes-all-five-facilities/)

&gt;I’m a local and watched a worker struggle last week to keep his bandana  on while he walked into the plant door to the upstairs crew courters.  These workers needed proper protection. We as a community during  quarantine HAD one of the lowest count of Covid-19 until we jumped into  reopening. Now our area is infested with this deadly virus.  In a  retirement community filled with elderly and vulnerable lives. 

While I am certainly happy that the Lincoln City outbreak is contained, I feel like the NY Times article is too reliant on company HR and doubt they have done nearly as much as claimed.",1,1596082977,oregon,2020-07-29 22:22:57

CoronaVirusPA,SanFranRePlant,Contact Tracing-or Lack Thereof,"&amp;#x200B;

 I found  this in my local paper (albeit, over a month old): Erie County Health Dept looking to hire 26 contract tracers at $17+ and hour.  The qualifications for contact tracing: "" *...don’t meet the job requirements, which include a bachelor’s degree in community health; public health; health education; natural, social, or behavioral science; or any equivalent combination of experience and training. A minimum of one year of applicable experience is required.""*

That seems like a high bar to set.

Is this the same country-wide?  Perhaps this is the reason the US lacks the proper contract tracing procedures and lead to this statement at a recent US Senate briefing:  ""Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said Friday that contact tracing simply isn't working in the U.S.""",1,1593692620,pennsylvania,2020-07-02 06:23:40

CoronaVirusPA,spamtasy,"WTF? Rep. Garth Everett just sent me an email telling me ""So, while I cannot tell you that there are no legal consequences to ignoring the (facemask) order, I can say legal action seems to be unlikely.""","Secretary Rachel Levine Issues New Mask Order
PA Health Secretary issued a new order this week on the wearing of masks in public spaces. The Secretary of the Department of Health’s order requiring the wearing of masks in public spaces doesn’t change anything. Gov. Tom Wolf already had a similar policy in place. The guidance is the same. If individuals cannot maintain social distancing in public spaces, masks should be worn.

The recent DOH Order does not change the previous “Green” guidance for businesses, restaurants, bars, religious services and other gatherings. It is a reiteration of guidance that the wearing of masks is a good idea when one is in close contact with individuals you do not know. It has been proven that COVID-19 can be spread by droplets or mist from the mouth and that masks inhibit that transmission. The actual exact risk level of not wearing masks is unknown.

As far as enforcement of this Order goes, one could be cited by a enforcement official for a summary offense which would have to be prosecuted in a Magistrate District Court. In Lycoming County, the District Attorney has stated that he will not prosecute these offenses and I understand that our MDJs have said that they are not interested in hearing enforcement cases. So, while I cannot tell you that there are no legal consequences to ignoring the order, I can say legal action seems to be unlikely.

I believe that this order was put in place because some bars, clubs and venues were making no effort to provide for distancing or other safety practices and because we are seeing an increase in the number of cases statewide. I think it is a reminder that COVID-19 has not gone away and that we need to continue to use reasonable precautions to ensure we do not spread this disease to those in our community who are vulnerable.

Here is my advice to those who operate businesses: If you feel that it is safe for your customers and employees to not wear masks, I believe that is your call. However, I would point out that you are probably putting your employees at greater risk than your customers.

To those of us who patronize businesses and attend gatherings: If you are not comfortable frequenting places where masks are not being worn and cannot maintain safe distancing you should probably go someplace else.

In my mind, this comes down to personal choice and responsibility and the level of risk one is willing to assume. I think it is important to remember that wearing masks and taking other precautions is not simply about protecting oneself-- it’s about protecting others.",1,1593710373,pennsylvania,2020-07-02 11:19:33

CoronaVirusPA,naxhi24,Any complaints/compliments about PA's response from people from outside PA?,"I live in Centre County (State College specifically), an area of the state that hasn't had it bad in comparison to the metropolitan areas (We have only had 200 cases total since March and the highest case growth we have seen was 11 on one day with average daily increase being between 1 and 6). The vast majority of residents here wear masks indoors (you occasionally see one or two bozos not wearing them). But when outdoors, the masks come off, and in general it seems that people don't really care about the masks when you are outdoors and not in some indoor space.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother on the other hand lives in Los Angeles, a city that has mandated that you can't be outside without a mask on. Now, my brother is super supportive of the quarantine and being safe, and it took him a lot of convincing for him to get on a plane back to Pittsburgh. 

&amp;#x200B;

He came to visit me two weeks ago and the difference between California and PA in terms of responding to Covid was shocking to him. As someone from LA, where you had to wear a mask when outside, period, seeing people not wear masks when outdoors was shocking to him. He kept saying how it was important that when you were outside the house, you had to wear a mask, and joked that we all looked ""like animals"" for that fact (though he did appreciate us all wearing masks inside shops and stuff). 

&amp;#x200B;

So that got me wondering, have any of you had visitors from outside PA compliment or complain to you about how good/bad PA is handling Covid?",4,1593792443,pennsylvania,2020-07-03 10:07:23

There were also a ton of them. You know those pickup trucks you see on the turnpike that have tried to cover significant body damage with Sunoco stickers?  That was what came to mind when I saw the white swan. 

I hadn’t thought about it previously, but I’m taking notes now of businesses that put out these signs.

CoronaVirusPA,wait_for_it_123,"My high risk wife is maid of honor for a medium size, indoor August wedding in SE suburbs. How to best handle the situation?","As the title describes my wife is high risk and we have been pretty conservative to protect her health.  Masks, social distancing, limited exposure to friends and family, etc.  Her friend has not cancelled her 125 person wedding and my wife understandably feels obligated to be there for important parts of the wedding while trying to stay safe.  The business has some policies in place to distance chairs, larger rooms but also had an optional mask policy (even during the ceremony).  

I expect a portion of the guest list will not attend, but the event has a number of high risk activities all rolled into one (large indoor gathering, bar, dancing, talking).  My wife is very aware of the risk but still trying to work something out that she can be safe (stay separate, not eat or drink, stay masked as much as possible). However I feel that attending the wedding period is simply not a good idea and she will have very limited control.  She’s in a tough spot and we’ve had some difficult conversations during which I voiced that she should not attend.

3. Copy of the Certificate of Occupancy  &amp; Use from X Township.

I'm not understanding why they're refusing to do the inspection through Zoom, or have them enter the premises and do their inspection while we sit in our car and they can complete it without us in the premises, or have us hire our own inspector who will do a Zoom inspection. It appears they want to walk-through with us in-person. The problem is there's narrow halls and small rooms where it's impossible for us to keep a 6 ft. plus distance.

Is there any hotline to call to report this? This seems extremely unsafe, and we've been ""quarantining"" or staying at home for 4 months now and not coming into contact with other people. The person I live with also has predisposed medical issues that would most likely cause him to die if he caught COVID-19. 

This seems extremely reckless on the part of the Township/Condo Association and I just don't know where to start. The person I live with can also get confirmation of all of this through a doctor's note. I feel so helpless and uncomfortable that they want to place our health at risk like this.",1,1594161544,pennsylvania,2020-07-07 16:39:04

CoronaVirusPA,bundt_hair,14 day recommended quarantine after travel,"Currently, PA has implemented a 14 day recommended quarantine after travelling to highly impacted states. A FB friend is going to NC with her husband and child this weekend and posting all about her trip while she is gone including check ins. She is self employed and makes an income setting up grocery store potato chip displays. I saw that someone warned her that her one week vacation has just become 3 weeks due to the recommended quarantine. She seems to not care about quarantining when she gets back, citing self employment. She knows about the quarantine, but it really doesn't look like she is going to follow it.

My questions are:

1.  If she comes back into PA and resumes setting up grocery store displays within the 2 weeks, to what authority do you report that? 

2. How does PA enforce something like this?

3. What would a grocery store do if they are notified that one of their vendors is setting up displays after having been vacationing on the beach in a highly affected area?

4. To whom in each grocery store do you report it?

I am not some vigilante but I'm really concerned for the public at large. This lady delivers to grocery stores known for having a large percentage of elderly patrons. She is touching EVERY product on display, which could spread this highly contagious illness like wild fire. I would report her if I had knowledge of her not honoring the recommended 14 day quarantine upon her return. Would I be out of line to report her?

Her kid is only 4 and her mother has dementia in a nursing home and she visits there frequently.

Thanks ahead of time for any feedback.

Sincerely, 
a Concerned Resident",1,1594471584,pennsylvania,2020-07-11 06:46:24

CoronaVirusPA,RoscoeTRatt,"People, it's about mutual protection.","**I was very happy to hear that there were no coronavirus deaths in Bucks County since July 1; for a moment I felt optimistic that we were getting ahead of the virus curve, but then I saw the news about Florida, Arizona and several other states that were setting records for new virus cases.** What had gone so wrong? I found my answer at a local park. I watched a group of teenagers playing a game of basketball with about a dozen adults cheering them on, and not a mask in sight. I understand that wearing a mask is almost impossible when playing physically active sports, but what price will be paid by that group of players? Hopefully, none, but if one of those players tests positive we then have about twenty people who could carry the virus to others. **It is my belief that the Corona virus is with us for the long term.** It looks like nothing short of a mandatory lock down and enforced use of masks in public places will slow the spread of this insidious disease.

CoronaVirusPA,CockLockDrop,Fayette County: Land of Denial,"It took Fayette County 88 days to reach 100 confirmed cases of COVID. Assuming the 200th case is reported today (currently at 196), it will have taken only 25 days to reach 200 cases. 


From the perspective of a casual observer, it would appear that Coronavirus ended in late May. Bars are open and packed. With the exception of large retail stores, masks are almost nonexistent. In gas stations, restaurants and dollar stores social distancing is largely ignored. In most places, cashiers and store employees don't wear masks or if they do, they're wearing them as ""chin guards"" rather than over their mouths and noses. As one would expect, parties and large gatherings are ubiquitous. 


It doesn't appear that the anti-mask majority in Fayette County have any sort of political motivation, rather it seems to be a matter of convenience and comfort along with a healthy dose of denial. 


I hope that wherever you're reading this from, your county is far less apathetic than mine.",1,1594650296,pennsylvania,2020-07-13 08:24:56

Update (as of 7/13/20 at 12:00 am): 

• 328 additional positive cases of COVID-19 

• 95,742 total cases statewide  

• 6,911 deaths statewide 

• 835,732 patients tested negative to date

Note: the state pulled yesterday's data off of the website mid-day, said their systems are under maintenance, and reposted the 7/11 instead. The daily Tweet was also deleted.

The [revised 7/12 PDF](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/COVID-19%20County%20Data/County%20Case%20Counts_7-12-2020.pdf) reports 95,414 total cases, which means there was +725 new cases yesterday, not the +577 that was originally reported. The difference, +148, was from Philadelphia County, which was originally omitted from the state count. ([state press release](https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/Health-Details.aspx?newsid=907)) I removed deaths, tests, and % positive from the table until revised data can be found. 

There were 6897 total deaths as of 7/11 and 6911 total deaths today for a two-day increase of 14/

I'm sorry that the data is incomplete. We should be back on track tomorrow.

&gt;**Updated Reopening Plan:** On July 1st, PA Governor Wolf released an updated order requiring face coverings and social distances: [Face Coverings Order](http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/2P61oXfC2m17HkJGDFm1BQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRg70JSP0RyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWR1Y2F0aW9uLnBhLmdvdi9TY2hvb2xzL3NhZmVzY2hvb2xzL2VtZXJnZW5jeXBsYW5uaW5nL0NPVklELTE5L1dhaXZlcnMvTWFza1dlYXJpbmcvUGFnZXMvZGVmYXVsdC5hc3B4VwdzY2hvb2xtQgoASNIODl-nS6mkUhFqYWtpYmJlQGdtYWlsLmNvbVgEAAAAAQ~~)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In response to this order, the District has made the following changes to our proposed Health and Safety plan for the 2020-2021 school year:  
  
&gt;  
&gt;All K-12 schools will open for in-person instruction on an alternating schedule, with families with last names A-K attending school on Mondays and Thursdays and families with last names L-Z attending school on Tuesdays and Fridays.  
&gt;  
&gt;Class sizes and numbers of students on buses would be reduced by approximately one-half. On days not attending in-person, children will receive remote instruction using District provided technology. Teachers would provide additional support virtually on Wednesdays.  
&gt;  
&gt;To keep families together, where there may be different last names of students in any given household, the last name of the oldest sibling would be used.  
&gt;  
&gt;Face coverings: A face covering can be a variety of materials, factory or homemade, and includes face shields. All students, teachers, and staff in District schools and buildings will be required to wear face coverings. However, due to much fewer children in school buildings on any given day, the proposed plan would allow students, when stationary in classrooms separated by 6 feet, to not have to wear masks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Laptops for each student will be distributed later this summer.  
&gt;  
&gt;**District Cyber Program:** Parents/guardians who are uncomfortable with in-person instruction will have the option of enrolling their child in Chambersburg Area Virtual Education (CAVE)...",2,1594757624,pennsylvania,2020-07-14 14:13:44

&gt;Philadelphia officials said Tuesday that fans would not be allowed to attend professional sports games — meaning the Eagles will not have spectators at any home games in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;The city on Tuesday announced a moratorium on all large public events that require public permits through February. Events at private venues, including sports stadiums, aren’t affected by that ban, but asked about Eagles games at a virtual news conference, officials said the teams would be allowed to play without crowds.  
&gt;  
&gt;The city has been in communication with the Eagles, said Managing Director Brian Abernathy, and has “told them our expectations are that they don’t have fans.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Abernathy said NFL guidelines also “remind teams that local authorities have the ability to ban fans, so I don’t expect any issues.”

CoronaVirusPA,kylebucket,PA UE Claim suddenly not open?,"So I’ve been filing claims for weeks now (since at least early June). I went to file my biweekly this AM and when I logged in I got [this](https://ibb.co/1qGZMbq). Why would my claim suddenly close? This is so frustrating as I now have to do another waiting week and this was the last week to collect the extra $600?! God knows you can’t call the UC center, so I’m just stuck having to reopen my claim, lose 2 weeks pay, and restart August 2nd?

Anyone with any experience with this?

**Edit:** When I check my claims status it says I’m still good to go and should file biweekly’s as scheduled. But, the original comment obviously supersedes that.

CoronaVirusPA,jkibbe,"Just 3 states meet these basic criteria to reopen and stay safe (NY, NJ, CT) -- Most states still need to reduce coronavirus cases and build up their testing capacity.","[https://www.vox.com/2020/5/28/21270515/coronavirus-covid-reopen-economy-social-distancing-states-map-data](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/28/21270515/coronavirus-covid-reopen-economy-social-distancing-states-map-data)

Experts told me states need three things to be safe to open. State leaders, from the governor to the legislature to health departments, need to ensure the SARS-CoV-2 virus is no longer spreading unabated. They need the testing capacity to track and isolate the sick and their contacts. And they need the hospital capacity to handle a potential surge in Covid-19 cases.

More specifically, states should meet at least five basic criteria. 

1. They should see a two-week drop in coronavirus cases, indicating that the virus is actually abating. **\[PA Rating: No Significant Drop\]**
2. They should have fewer than four daily new cases per 100,000 people per day — to show that cases aren’t just dropping but are also below dangerous levels. **\[PA Rating: 4 to 9 per 100,000; too high\]**
3. They need at least 150 new tests per 100,000 people per day, letting them quickly track and contain outbreaks. **\[PA Rating: 100 to 150 new tests per 100,000 people per day; too low\]**
4. They need an overall positive rate for tests below 5 percent — another critical indicator for testing capacity. **\[PA Rating: 5 to 10%; too high\]**
5. And states should have at least 40 percent of their ICU beds free to actually treat an influx of people stricken with Covid-19 should it be necessary. **\[PA Rating: 60 to 70% occupied; too high\]** 

So far, most states are not there. As of July 22, just three states — Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York — met four or five of the goals, which demonstrates strong progress. Twenty-two states and Washington, DC, hit two or three of the benchmarks. The other 25 achieved zero or one.",29,1595559634,pennsylvania,2020-07-23 21:00:34

CoronaVirusPA,spartman20,"This truly is a mystery illness. High risk family member tested positive and got it very lightly, almost no symptoms...","My daughter's dad is 45 and is what used to be called ""morbidly obese"" (over 100lbs overweight, over 40 BMI), and he's generally just been a very unhealthy person, very poor diet, for several years now. High blood pressure he's on medicine for as well.  A co-worker of his got a positive test so he got tested Sunday afternoon and just got back his positive test.

I realize he's not out of the woods yet but last Thursday and Friday he had slight congestion and a little fatigue and muscle aches.  Two-three days later he was back to his normal and since has had zero symptoms.  I always worried if he got Covid he may not survive it because of his health and extreme weight.  This really proves to me what a mystery this illness really still is, some healthy young people on ventilators and then folks with multiple underlying conditions go virtually unharmed.

To make matters worse, he's been house sitting for us while we are away (to care for our pets) this week and now I have no idea how and when to go back to our home that he's been living in for a week!!  I've been out of town with my 8yo daughter and my parents who are 79 years old and we may have already infected them.  This whole situation is such a mess!

*By Aneri Pattani and Sara Simon of Spotlight PA*

&gt;HARRISBURG — As coronavirus cases continue to rise in Pennsylvania, the state health department has received approval to spend nearly $27 million to ramp up contact tracing efforts, warning of potentially dire consequences if it’s unable to do so quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;Contact tracing — the practice of locating people who have come in contact with individuals infected with COVID-19 and asking them to quarantine — is a key public health tool. Alongside wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and implementing widespread testing, experts say it’s one of the best ways to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, the state is looking to outside companies for help with this critical work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Official documents show the health department has filed at least two emergency requests, using an expedited contracting process, to hire companies to assist with contact tracing. **One proposed contract** [**for $25 million**](http://www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/PrintVersion.aspx?m=EP&amp;id=18187) **is with an Atlanta-based staffing agency to recruit, hire, and train up to 4,000 tracers in 90 days. The other,** [**for nearly $2 million**](http://www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/PrintVersion.aspx?m=EP&amp;id=18013)**, is with an Irish software company to launch a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone app that could notify users if they’ve been in close contact with an infected individual.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Neither contract has been finalized yet, according to a department spokesperson.

CoronaVirusPA,Beer_Belly_Bill,Antibody Testing - My Experience at Labcorp,"Today I got my antibody test and figured I’d share my experiences for anyone curious. 

Background
I was in Europe for 2 weeks in mid-late February. Spent time in 5 countries, but between layovers and all, really was in 7. The last stop was Venice, Italy and I was on a boat to the airport as things were shutting down. Never had symptoms when I got back but maybe a month later had “allergies”.  My mom was super sick in April. We think she had it too. 

The Test
I signed up on Labcorp’s site. I didn’t need a doctor recommendation because they can do that for you. It was a $10 service fee I paid online with my CC. That cannot be expensed through insurance. I schedule the appointment and today I went. Showed up maybe 10 minutes early. Did the express check-in. They saw me almost immediately. Showed me to a room, took a very tiny vile of blood. I’m not a needle person, but they did a great job. Super easy. In and out in less than 20 minutes. Results will come in 2 days to the Labcorp patient portal. 

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask or PM me if you want to ask privately.",1,1595872572,pennsylvania,2020-07-27 11:56:12

&gt;The Marlins learned Sunday morning that their starting pitcher for the afternoon and two other players had tested positive for COVID-19 and would be unable to play. An apparent coronavirus outbreak was underway in the visiting clubhouse at Citizens Bank Park and the Marlins responded by asking their shortstop to determine if the game against the Phillies would be played.  
&gt;  
&gt;“He’s kind of an unofficial team captain of our club,” Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Miguel Rojas. “He’s always texting the group and getting the feelings of the group. So when we’re dealing with situations or things, that’s usually who we’re working through.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Major League Baseball issued a 113-page operations manual to all club employees before the start of the season. It outlines everything from on-field rules to testing procedures and what happens if a player tests positive. But Sunday afternoon, the status of the game amid a coronavirus outbreak was decided by a group text-message between Marlins players.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We made the decision that we’re going to continue to do this and we’re going to continue to be responsible and just play the game as hard as we can,” Rojas said.

CoronaVirusPA,WildTomorrow,Don’t forget preventative healthcare during these times!,"I had my normal dental cleaning and exam in January and I always make my 6 month appointment right at my previous appointment. Well for all you math folks out there, 6 months from January is July. And now it’s July. 

I was just at my dentist for a normal cleaning and exam and just wanted to share my experience.

First you get there and you call the office and they’ll tell you to come in (I assume they’ll tell you to wait if the waiting room is busy). You walk in, they take your temperature and then you fill out a questionnaire and then wait like you normally would at a dentist office. Except normally, there’s like 15+ chairs in the waiting room. There’s now only 4 and they’re very spaced out. 

Dental hygienist comes to get you and you go back to the exam rooms. They have a plastic barrier between the exam room area and the rest of the office (plus the door that’s always there). I go in, sit down, and then use hand sanitizer. Then they had me rinse my mouth for a minute with mint flavored hydrogen peroxide, not exactly enjoyable, but it makes sense. 

Then the cleaning starts. It’s mostly the same as before except they had me hold the little suction funnel right below my mouth which seemed to work pretty well. Normally during my cleanings, the goggles they give me end up covered in water drops but this time there was nothing. Cleaning finishes, doctor comes in to take a look, everything with the doctor was basically normal. 

To polish my teeth, I just had to wear a plastic face shield and other than that it was the same as before. Flossed after polishing and then I rinsed.

Also cases rising again, and East Goshen (a town that is part of WCASD) has seen a large spike in last few days.  So yea, my 13 year old will be home until at least thanksgiving. Great.

What makes me furious is that so many people would rather let kids die than deal with this virus the right way. Europe didn't fuck around, and they have the virus semi-controlled. If people just followed 2 basic rules, our numbers would be low enough to talk about going back. 

I don't know how we are ever going to get rid of this if we keep taking one step forward and two steps back. I'm starting to lose faith in Gov.

CoronaVirusPA,recovering_lurker27,COVID Response Survey Results,"Hello again, everyone, and thank you for helping me with my survey a few weeks ago. For anyone that's interested, here are the results of my survey. I received a total of 1,062 responses from 44 states plus DC, 113 of which were from Pennsylvania.

Overall, 49% believe the virus needs to be taken more seriously than it is now, 26% say it is not as serious as they were led to believe, 13% say it was portrayed appropriately and 11% say it was totally overblown. In PA, 60% of respondents said it needs to be taken more seriously, 25% said it was either totally overblown or that it was less serious than they first believed.

55% say that government needs to do more to address the pandemic. 23% say actions taken went too far, 11% say actions were totally unjustified, and 10% say actions so far have been appropriate. In PA, 68% said more action is needed, compared to 24% who said actions went too far or were totally unjustified.

The Federal govt's response was widely panned, with 80% either strongly or somewhat disapproving vs 14% somewhat or strongly approving. (89 vs 7% in PA). State responses were also underwater generally 56%-37%. Pennsylvanians, however, gave their state higher marks, approving 73% to 25%. Local/County responses generally had 45% disapprove, 38% approve, with 17% neutral. In PA, local responses had 25% disapprove, 47% approve, 28% neutral. It is important to note that this does not differentiate between those dissatisfied because they gov't did not do enough and those dissatisfied because the gov't did too much.

Overall, about three quarters of respondents said that wearing a mask (75.6%) and social distancing (76.7%) were somewhat or very important (87% for both in PA). Similar numbers said that they wear a mask (78.8%) and social distance (76.8%) in public most or all of the time, with the remainder stating that they do them half of the time or less (91% and 89% in PA).

A correlation test found that, among other things, there is a strong positive relationship between how serious someone viewed the threat of the virus to be and how important they think that masks and distancing are, although the relationship is slightly less strong between that perception and whether or not they actually do those things. A moderate but significant relationship was found between having more liberal views and having a negative opinion about the federal government's response, as well as placing more importance on masks and distancing.

If anyone has any questions please let me know! If for some reason anyone would like to take a look at my dataset or R code, please send me a DM. Thank you again for your help in this project!",1,1596213307,pennsylvania,2020-07-31 10:35:07
CoronaVirusPA,thefirststoryteller,Update to University of Pennsylvania's plans for fall semester,"In an email sent out today around noon EST, Provost Wendell Pritchett writes:

&gt;
When we announced our plans for the fall semester last month, we indicated that we would provide updates as new information became available regarding the pandemic and the University’s operations. Today we write to provide you with the latest information on our plans for the coming academic year.

 

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our University’s planning and actions have been driven by two fundamental principles: that we do everything within our powers to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and community, and that we provide our students with the very finest educational experience possible under these extraordinary and challenging circumstances. As we began planning for the upcoming academic year, we were well aware that bringing college students together from across the country and around the world in the midst of a pandemic presented uniquely difficult challenges. This has become ever more apparent as the pandemic has continued to spread over the past month with young people becoming the fastest growing cohort.

 

In our message concerning the fall on June 25th, we stressed that our decision was guided by the most current medical information and governmental directives, and cautioned that our plans could change depending on the progression of the pandemic. It is now evident that rather than plateauing during the summer, as many health experts expected, COVID-19 has instead gained momentum. Since our June 25 message, 1.5 million new cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the United States, with the confirmed case count soaring from 2.4 million on June 25 to 3.9 million on July 22. This means that almost 40% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States since the beginning of the pandemic have been reported in the last month. 

 

Against this backdrop and as the pandemic continues to progress, the University’s planning has evolved on several fronts.

 

THE MAJORITY OF INSTRUCTION WILL BE ONLINE

 

Undergraduate courses for the Fall semester are being offered online, with a few, limited, in person offerings. For undergraduates in the Nursing School, the only in-person course work will be clinical simulations, experiences in the hospital, and clinical settings. For students in the other three undergraduate schools, a minimal number of courses will be offered in-person where it is essential to have an in-person experience in order to meet curricular and/or pedagogical requirements.  Penn first-year international students can get a support letter from their academic school/department to confirm that they are attending a hybrid program in Fall 2020. If an in-person course is offered, accommodations will be provided for those studying remotely. Instructors may elect to come to campus for in-person office hours or to meet in person with students from time to time.  These interactions are outside-the-classroom activities and comparable interactions will also be provided online.

 

REPEATED COVID-19 TESTING REQUIRED

 

One of the essential pillars of our reopening plan is testing for the virus. Penn will be requiring all undergraduate students who are returning to Philadelphia – regardless of whether they are living on or off-campus – to take a minimum of two COVID tests to participate as a member of the Penn community this fall.

 

Pre-Arrival Testing

 

We are now requiring that all students residing in the United States who plan to be on campus for the fall have a negative COVID-19 test within 14 days prior to arrival on campus. As a convenience to undergraduates and families, Penn has arranged with a private third-party testing laboratory for a COVID-19 testing kit to be delivered to each domestic student at their home address. These test kits contain detailed instructions. The kits also come with a postage paid envelope for return of the test to the testing laboratory.

 

If you intend to return to campus this fall, you must verify the address where your test kit will be shipped. This should be the location where you will be for the two weeks prior to your coming to Philadelphia. Please provide this shipping information in Penn InTouch as soon as possible, and no later than 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, August 2. When you receive the test, you will be given further instructions. Please follow the instructions closely. The test should be administered and returned as promptly as possible in order to ensure you receive the result prior to your departure for Philadelphia. The Announcements section in Penn InTouch will have additional details about shipping.

 

Once the test results are available, they will be provided to the University and the undergraduate via an app of the distributor of the test kit. If a student tests positive from the pre-arrival test kit, they should remain in isolation at home for 14 days from their test date. They should start all classes remotely until they can travel safely to Philadelphia after completing their isolation period.

 

Arrival Testing for Students Living On and Off-Campus

 

Upon arrival on campus, students will again be tested for COVID-19. All students who plan to live in on-campus housing, whether in college housing or Greek houses, will receive instructions prior to move-in, which will include an assigned date, time and location to report first for an on-campus arrival test before moving into their on-campus residence. Students will be required to quarantine until they receive a negative test result. Accommodations and meals will be provided to students required to quarantine in college housing. The testing and move-in process will differ depending on the student’s assigned arrival date. In order to maintain a safe move-in process, there will be very limited exceptions for requests to adjust assigned dates and times.

 

Although undergraduates living in off-campus housing will not have assigned move-in dates, they will nevertheless be required to complete a COVID-19 arrival test. These students should coordinate with their roommates and landlords so that arrival in shared residences can occur over a series of days to minimize contact with others. All students, whether living on- or off-campus, are required to attest to the Student Campus Compact and to abide by all required testing, quarantine and isolation protocols and behavioral expectations. Students already in the Philadelphia area, and students not yet in Philadelphia who plan to live in off-campus housing, should register for their arrival test as early as possible. Details on registering will be provided shortly. Questions about the testing program can be sent to coronavirus@upenn.edu. All student arrival testing needs to be completed no later than September 2, 2020. Failure to complete testing in a timely manner will result in restrictions to access to campus and/or academic resources.

 

Additionally, for international students and students arriving from states that are designated by the Pennsylvania Department of Health as hotspots, public health guidance from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends quarantine for 14 days upon arrival to Philadelphia. To minimize risk of spreading COVID-19, the University will require all international students and students arriving from “hotspot” states to take an additional third test within five to seven days of when their first on-campus test was administered.  The University will deliver meals to students in quarantine who live in college housing.  Penn will do all that we can to support these students. Additional information will be provided by VPUL and the college houses.

 

Both the pre-arrival and on campus arrival testing will be paid for by the University as well as the additional testing discussed above for international and students from domestic “hotspot” states.

 

Fall Semester

 

Starting September 1, we will test all members of the Penn community who have symptoms or others who do not have symptoms but have been identified as close contacts in a testing center we will be opening in the Hall of Flags in Houston Hall.

 

Students will also be required to participate in surveillance testing, details of which will be provided at a later date.

 

SYMPTOM MONITORING &amp; CONTACT TRACING (PennOpen Pass)

 

Students who are coming to campus for any reason will be required to enroll in our symptom tracking program, PennOpen Pass, which we have been using successfully already for members of the Penn community. PennOpen Pass is a daily symptom checker to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the Penn community.  Daily symptom tracking is critical to reducing the spread of COVID-19 in our community as it will enable clinical staff and contact tracers to act quickly if COVID-19 is detected and to connect affected individuals to care. We are requiring anyone coming to campus with any regularity to perform daily symptom checks using PennOpen Pass before the start of each day including weekends, regardless of whether they are reporting to campus on that particular day.

 

If you have no symptoms and have not been in recent contact with someone who may have COVID-19, you get a Day Pass to enter Penn buildings.  Otherwise, the tool will direct you to next steps.  More information for students about PennOpen Pass will be forthcoming.

 

COMPLYING WITH THE STUDENT CAMPUS COMPACT

 

A successful fall semester is predicated on vigilance with regard to testing and contact tracing, individual decisions to act responsibly, and adherence to the Student Campus Compact by all Penn students regardless of whether they live on or off campus.  We want to emphasize that there will be strict enforcement of the Student Campus Compact. If you are unable or unwilling to follow the requirements of the Compact, you should not return to Penn – whether living on- or off-campus. Failure to follow the requirements of the Compact may result in students being sent home.

 

Among other things, the Student Campus Compact requires students:

 

To collaborate with Penn on daily wellness checks with the new PennOpen Pass mobile program (details to be distributed), monitoring for symptoms, being tested as recommended by health professionals, and tracking your contacts should you test positive, as part of your public service to protecting your fellow students and Penn community members.
To maintain appropriate (6 feet) physical distance from others whenever possible.
To wear a facial covering when you leave your place of residence.
To wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds throughout each day and before and after interactions with others.
To use alcohol-based disinfectant wipes provided throughout campus buildings to clean surfaces with which you come into contact, including but not limited to desks and seats in classrooms.
To be up-to-date on all vaccines.
To receive a flu shot.
To refrain from having guests, including family members, in your campus residence.
To refrain from allowing individuals without a green “go” screen on the PennOpen Pass mobile checker to enter campus buildings.
To refrain from organizing, hosting, or attending events, parties, or other social gatherings off-campus that may cause safety risks to you and other members of the community.",1,1596214369,pennsylvania,2020-07-31 10:52:49
CoronaVirusPA,Kines_Researcher,Help us understand if physical activity and fitness levels influence COVID symptoms (academic research) Discussion,"Hello everyone,

I hope you don't mind, but we think this study might be of interest to some individuals living in Pennsylvania.

We (researchers from the University of the Fraser Valley, BC, Canada) are looking for individuals (19+ years of age) who have had COVID-19 (as indicated by a +ive test) and are of ***any*** fitness level to complete an online survey. The online survey consist of 3 parts: demographic variables, COVID-19 symptoms, and physical activity/fitness levels prior to being infected. The survey takes about 6-8 minutes to complete.

The aim of our study is to learn if physical activity levels have any influence on the number of symptoms, durations and severity of symptoms, as well as any complications associated with having COVID-19.

CoronaVirusPA,MotherOfPercephone,What do I say to my PARENTS?,"My parents are going to sing Happy Birthday to their 11 year old Grandson. I already have a lot of symptoms of COVID that I got when I went to visit them a couple of weeks ago to dig some holes for their garden.  We  were outside and a friend of a friend stopped by. I was digging with no mask and before I realized it, he came up behind me and I turned around and he was within breathing distance!! GRRR!!  

THAT NIGHT,  I had a sore throat and have been sick with many many symptoms. I'm 50 years old and NEVER EVER had a cold sore, ever and I got one along with swollen lymph nodes on my chin and some other thing that looks like a pimple, but isn't ,on the side of my nose and much  much more. All this within ONE WEEK of being there.  It's been a month now. 

My parents KNOW this. I got the antibody test and it says negative, but, I have WAY too many symptoms to dismiss and need to get PCR testing instead. 

Last week,  the mutual friend died . They are calling it a drug overdose, but, he tested positive for COVID.  I know "" the breather on ihs bicycle"" is riding around town, had to have either seen the one who just died, or saw someone he knew. It's a small town. That's how it works.  My parents know this too. They know the  one who breathed on me hangs out with and has friends in common with the one who just died. 

I told them that studies are coming out saying COVID can make young boys sterile but, this is still the response I got today when they were on their way over to sing Happy Birthday to their 11 year old Grandson with his 5 year old brother and parents who aren't taking this virus as serious as they should, either. 

What do you say at this point when it's your parents that don't care if they get sick or if they infect their children or grandchildren? "" Oh Well"". That's the answer I got.

CoronaVirusPA,iiSquatS,"Mother of my child going to a wedding in PA, can someone answer some questions for me?","The mother of my child and I both live in Florida, but one of her friends are getting married next weekend and she flew up (with our child) and is staying with her parents, but obviously seeing all her old friends then next Saturday, going to an outside wedding of 150 people. (Just her, not the child. He will be with her mom) 

Too give me details, the wedding is in Hunker, PA. I’m nervous about a few things. How strict are businesses abiding by all the “laws”? Also wondering, since it’s an outside wedding at a Winery, I’m wondering if they all have more “loose” rules since it’s a private wedding IE: curious as to if people will be allowed to dance to music, since the wedding isn’t open to the public. I know I said it’s at a winery, but since everyone will have drinks, they won’t be wearing masks, and I highly, HIGHLY doubt all the people will be abiding by the distance rule. It’s hard to control 150 people where most will be buzzed/drunk. 

I’m nervous because 150 people at a single wedding is quite large. She tells me the cases in PA aren’t nearly as bad, and in some counties there are little to none, so I should have nothing to worry about. I worry about her being exposed, then the next morning going back to our child, and even her mom and dad. I think still having the wedding right now is a little stupid. If someone can give me more insight up there, or about weddings and events etc... I’ll love you forever. 

Like I said, I know places have like dancing and certain things banned, but I don’t see how if they rented out a Winery and having the reception there after, how they could possibly enforce rules like that, or even if the management of the venue wouldn’t let it be a little more “lax” since it’s a wedding and private. 

I know this was long, but if anyone could give me insight or help or any info, I’ll buy you a beer next time I visit Pittsburgh!",1,1596572164,pennsylvania,2020-08-04 14:16:04

They wanted to retain me in this position, but the School Board just voted to delay a hybrid reopening model and go all-virtual for the time being.  This means that I am out of a job.

CoronaVirusPA,Ambitious_Photo_517,Link for Reporting Businesses for Mask Noncompliance and things to keep in mind.,"I've seen a lot of posts in this sub asking for advice for reporting businesses for mask noncompliance or bad mask policy. 

I wanted to offer a post that people can reference back to with a link.

This is the site where you can report businesses:

https://expressforms.pa.gov/apps/pa/doh/COVID-19-Complaint

**As I've stated in several other posts you can submit this report without filling out your name and contact information.**

Tonight during his ""fireside chat"" State Senator Doug Mastriano again threatened to do [everything in his power to get a list of names of individuals who have reported businesses for non-compliance by using PA's open records law](https://www.facebook.com/SenatorDougMastriano/videos/2692751871012996/) (approx 12 minutes in) apparently with the intent to distribute those names to harass those individuals. He has made this threat several times. 

Again you can submit this form without filling out your name. 

Tonight's chat included a new threat to get the IP addresses of those who submit these tips but choose to remain anonymous. To be honest I have no idea if he would be able to get this information and I'm not sure how he even expects to cross reference that IP with private ISP data. 

That said the following is basic advice on how to stay anonymous. 

You can use a VPN shield your IP address and remain anonymous when submitting these complaints. 

For a list of VPN's and their privacy policies I would use https://thatoneprivacysite.net/#simple-vpn-comparison to start a comparison. 

Four to consider would be NordVPN, Tunnelbear, Mullvad and ProtonVPN. Mozilla has also recently launched a VPN but at this time Mozilla does not have a client for Linux or Mac OS if that's important to you. 

This could start a general discussion on privacy, anonymity, and the internet but that would be a bit outside of this post. 

Again That One Privacy site has a much longer discussion on VPNs that is worth reading.

2nd question:  Does this mean that my employer assumed I QUIT my job when I gave them the doctor's excuse?  They made no effort to make the workplace safe for high-risk employees.  They offered me a secondary position right away, which **I had to decline** because it would still involving customer-interaction and answering phones, running cash register.  My main job was pizza delivery.

CoronaVirusPA,jkibbe,Pa. recommends no school sports until 2021: Gov. Wolf,"[https://www.pennlive.com/sports/2020/08/pa-recommends-no-school-sports-until-2021-gov-wolf.html](https://www.pennlive.com/sports/2020/08/pa-recommends-no-school-sports-until-2021-gov-wolf.html)

&gt;Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said Thursday he believes there should be no sports in Pennsylvania for the remainder of the year.  
&gt;  
&gt;During a his press conference, Wolf was asked about the PIAA giving sports the green light to resume athletics in the state, to which he responded that “the recommendation is that we don’t do any sports until January 1st.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“The guidance is that we ought to avoid any congregate settings,” Wolf said. “And that means anything that brings people together is going to help that virus get us and we ought to do everything we can to defeat that virus. So any time we get together for any reason, that’s a problem because it makes it easier for that virus to spread.”

CoronavirusNE,BlueKnight72,North East Safe Zone Petition," [http://chng.it/nFcfs6MwXT](http://chng.it/nFcfs6MwXT)

As of mid-July 2020, the COVID 19 outbreak seems to be under control in the Northeastern States.  To be specific; Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey seem to have achieved a certain level of control of the virus.  Further outbreaks springing from sources within these states seems rather unlikely at this point as these states have developed the necessary protocols to contain such outbreaks as they occur and the residents of the area are keen to avoid the surges that are happening in other place in the country. The people of the Northeast have done their part.  Now it is time to secure these gains and try to get to as normal a life as possible.

Given the density of the major cities of the North East, especially New York City, complete elimination is unlikely even without considering the spread of the virus from other states and regions.  This fact, given that it would be virtually impossible (as well as economically undesirable), in any case, to eliminate travel from other states, the progress that the Northeastern states have made in controlling the virus is going to be insecure for the foreseeable future.

Recognizing the complete abdication of responsibility and leadership in Washington that we have seen in these recent months, the continuing outbreaks in other states and regions, and the likely prospect of the pandemic continuing for some time to come; it is necessary and entirely proper for the aforementioned states to take all cooperative action necessary to secure the health and safety of their residents and enable the further recovery of the regional economy.

In addition, these states could, by acting together, help the rest of the nation bring the pandemic under long term control.  The leadership vacuum left by the federal government could be filled by the states of the Northeast acting in common.  While some of these measures are without precedent in the United States, the people of this nation and the world find themselves all fighting for their both their very lives and their economic security.  In such an environment, the people and their states, having been all but abandoned by the national government have a duty to do all that is necessary to protect their people. 

Accordingly, the following program should be implemented without delay.

1)     Objective:  Creation of a safe zone containing the states mentioned above.  This Zone should be implemented by a body incorporated by those states (called the Governance Board here for simplicity) and granted all powers by those state collectively necessary to accomplish:

a.      The control, minimization, and elimination of the COVID19 virus within the borders of the zone.

b.      The prevention of outside sources of infection to the extent that these measures comply with the US Constitution and Federal Law.

c.      The minimization of the economic effects of the COVID19 and necessary business shutdowns related to the virus to the extent that this can be achieved without allowing the increased spread of the virus.

2)     Powers: To accomplish the objective the following state police powers must be granted to the Governing Board, these powers, while not replacing the powers of the States themselves would override them in the event of conflict. The powers would be merely temporary grants from the states and therefore have all the same limits as the powers of the state.

a.      Monitoring and Control of Commerce and Travel within the zone.  All powers possessed by the states in this regard to be granted to the Board.

b.      Patrol and Control the Boundaries of the Zone.  All powers possessed by the states in this regard to be granted to the Board. 

c.      Build such improvements and facilities that may be reasonably considered necessary for the fight against the virus.   

d.      Commandeer personnel and equipment from the states with the cost of use to be shared among the states collectively.

e.      Communicate with the public to encourage such actions as may be necessary to defend the zone and control the virus.

3)     Boundaries: All states within the zone to contribute state police (and possibly national guard) forces as well as medical personnel to patrol the boundaries of the safe zone.  Such forces would be deputized to act appropriately within all states in the zone. 

a.      With the Canadian border basically closed to travel at this time, the initial boundary would be the NY-PA state line, combine with the NJ-PA and NJ-DE state line. 

b.      While restricting travel would be illegal and undesirable, checks at the boundary (and airports/ seaports to gather information of traveler’s purpose, origin, and destination would be conducted.  With the contribution of the entire region, these checks could be sufficiently manned to not unduly hinder travel.  Freight shipments would be basically exempt.  The information gathered from these checks would be shared with all state authorities in the safe zone (as well as with other states and federally, if desired).

c.      If properly equipped these checkpoints could check temperatures and even administer COVID tests as appropriate.

d.      Appropriate Quarantine of travelers intending to stay in the zone would be mandated, with sufficiently deterrent fines and possibly detention for non-compliance.    (Quarantine periods could be shortened with sufficient testing). 

1.      Various hotels and other facilities could be established as quarantine centers to allow travel into the zone. 

e.      Contiguous states (or possibly sub-divisions thereof) could join the safe zone upon achievement of specified criteria in controlling the virus.  Thus, the boundary of the safe zone could be expanded.  This would enable the marshaled resources of additional states and localities to be added to the common enterprise.  For example, it could be possible to add Delaware and/or Pennsylvania to the zone in the not-too-distant future.  

1.      Conversely, the common resources of all states within the zone could be brought to bear to contain and eventually eliminate local outbreaks.  This would enable such outbreaks to be dealt with without undue strain on the resources of any one state. 

2.      It is even possible to imagine such as safe zone, over the course of a few years, expanding to cover the entire nation thus ending the most damaging effects of this pandemic.  Although one hopes that an effective vaccine will be available before this occurs, this can’t be taken as a certainty.   

           ii.     While much of the boundary line between NY &amp; PA forest land and lightly inhabited, in NJ, the PA state line straddles several metropolitan areas.  The largest is the Philadelphia metropolitan area, which extends deep into south Jersey.  (Trenton and Allentown-Bethlehem may be other such areas).  Where this is the case, a system with a buffer zone should be implemented.  The exact boundaries would need to be determined based on employment patterns, population density, and transit facilities.  Residents of the buffer zone would have dedicated lanes allowing them to skip checkpoints (verified by Easy pass and license plate photos).   Regional Rail &amp; Buses would have simple ID checks to verify residency in the zone.  PA residing employees of employers in the buffer zone could be granted passes that could enable them to cross the boundary line without checks. 

1.      While this would add a bit of “leakage” to the zone, sampling of human waste in the buffer zone communities would allow ample warning of potential outbreaks, allowing for remedial action. 

2.      In any case, this accommodation is probably necessary for the entire scheme to work and not cause undue economic hardship. 

3.      If necessary, another checkpoint could be added at the boundary of the buffer zone which could be activated only if increases in cases in the buffer zone were detected. 

4)     Intra-Zone dynamics

a.      Once boundaries are established, restrictions on intra-zone travel could be relaxed.  For example, travel by bus, train, or air between New York City and Boston could be allowed with the restrictions on total capacity eased substantially.  The establishment of the zone itself would increase confidence in the safety of such travel.  This would go a long way towards reviving the regional economy.

b.      Common restrictions on everyday life (ie. dining, personal services, etc.) should be agreed upon between states and well publicized within the zone.  With the common resources of the states within the zone, cases could be driven to lower levels to ease restrictions further. 

i.     To provide for the event that such restrictions become necessary in certain remote regions due to an influx of visitors, a common tax should be established on fuel and passenger travel tickets as well as a surcharge on toll roads.  This money would be used to compensate small businesses affected by these travel-related temporary restrictions.  This tax would also have the effect of discouraging unnecessary travel generally.

1.      Other taxes and fees should be levied in as necessary to pay for the creation, maintenance, and operations of the zone.  The economic effects of controlling the virus will probably make these taxes pay for themselves.   Given the peril faced by Maine, for example, if an outbreak should occur in New Hampshire, the costs shuld be borne in common.

2.      A financing authority could be chartered allowing the states to issue bonds to fight the virus with each state taking a proportion of the repayment burden consistent with its economy and population.  Defined revenue sources in terms of taxes, fees, and tolls could be identified for these bonds and favorable borrowing terms established

    ii.     Confidence in the low probability of infection inside the zone would allow many if not most business to fully reopen as has already been happening in some European countries. 

c.      Control of the virus and the creation of the zone may very well allow certain mass attractions (ie. museums, theme parks, sporting events, ski resorts) to reopen to the public.  The terms of these reopening should be agreed upon in common and as should specific criteria have established for re-closing such attractions if that becomes necessary.   

d.      States are already cooperating in the purchase of testing supplies &amp; PPE. This should continue and a common stockpile should be created.  However, given the failure of the federal government to invoke the defense production act as needed, states in the zone should use all means at their disposal to encourage production both within and without the zone.  Laws could be passed denying the right of companies that could but won’t produce necessary supplies from bidding on state and local contracts for the next several decades.  Such companies should be named publicly, and boycotts encouraged.  This would be beneficial to the entire country.  In the absence of federal action, state and local officials should use every power and bit of leverage available to obtain necessary supplies. 

    i.     If necessary, publicly-owned corporations or public-private partnerships could be created to identify available industrial assets in the region and finance the adaption of these assets into appropriate manufacturing facilities.  The demand for this equipment is basically guaranteed for the foreseeable future, and even if it isn't, creating an equipment stockpile would also be beneficial. 

e.      State congressional delegations should be coordinated to act in common for the interest of the region and to coordinate federal action against the virus in general and possibly remedy the shocking abdication of responsibility in Washington.  The congressional delegations should caucus together, ignoring party and chamber divisions and vote in block and propose as a caucus on legislation having to do with virus control once a decision is reached in the caucus.  Other legislators from outside the could be brought into the caucus if they agree to these terms.  Recalcitrant legislators in the zone should be subjected to recall elections and whatever other measures can be used against them. 

                                                    i.     One primary purpose of this caucus will to be to provide all possible political cover to the creation and maintenance of the safe zone. 

5)     Outside the Zone

a.      Once the Zone is established, it may be possible to establish handshake agreements with the Canadian Government and other countries to allow residents of the safe zone to travel to other nations that have successfully controlled the virus.  This will go further to reviving the economy.  In addition, it is possible that confidence in the integrity of the zone would allow for the resumption of tourism from the “safer” countries. 

                                                    i.     Such agreements would need to be monitored as other nations may suffer new waves of the virus and travel may need to be restricted again. 

                                                   ii.     It may be desirable and possible to coordinate virus response with the Canadian government.

b.      Attempts by the federal government, other states, or business interests to disrupt the zone by legal or economic means should be resisted with a common effort.  In practical terms this means:

                                                    i.     A common legal fund to defend measures creating and maintaining the zone in court.  This will probably be the main arena that a confrontation with the federal government will occur.

                                                   ii.     Organized boycotts and other voluntary economic actions against businesses and localities that attempt to disrupt the zone through litigation or other means.

1.      The financial sector in the Northeast may be particularly useful in this regard.  The interests of the sector in controlling the virus in the Northeast and elsewhere seems to align the interests of the zone with the interest of the financial sector, but other inducements could be used to get finance on board as necessary.

2.      Actions by the congressional delegations of other states should be noted and responded to as appropriate. 

3.      A fund for campaign contributions, political advertisements, and public relations should be created and deployed as necessary to both defend the zone and promote the leadership of the zone in fighting the virus.

a.      Material assistance to other localities may be appropriate as both a PR strategy and bringing the virus under control more generally.

6)     Operating Structure of the Zone

a.      Given the necessity of quick action, the Governing Board should be composed of one representative (appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the legislature) from each state.  Although some states will obviously contribute more than others in accord with population and resources, the fact that all states must stay on board for the enterprise to succeed dictates that all states be given a formally equal say. 

                                                    i.     The representatives should pick a Chairperson as a first among equals.  Given that NY, NJ, and MA will unavoidably have great sway given their resources, the Chairperson should be from one of the other states in order to assuage any anxieties of the smaller states.  The defection of even a single state from the arrangement dooms the whole thing, so all the states must tread a bit carefully.

                                                   ii.     Outside of a small staff of experts, the personnel, equipment, and facilities commanded by the Board should be requisitioned from the State governments.  Each state should be compensated for the use of personnel and equipment from a common fund.

                                                  iii.     The States and (all localities through them) should commit to quick binding arbitration for any disputes that they have with the board.  Though it should be possible to appeal the decisions of arbitration those decisions should automatically stand while appeals are in process.

                                                  iv.     Any expansion of the Boards powers should be required to be unanimous

b.      When the Pandemic is over, the Board should be disbanded, other than some of the expert staff, which should be used for planning for future pandemics and as a nucleus to recreate the organization if necessary and consented to by the states. 

7)     Conclusion: 

Although the measure described here may be described as extreme, and against the spirit of the Union which ought to be pervasive in these United States, circumstance has forced them to be seriously considered.  This disaster has been allowed by the incompetence and inaction of the national government.  The state governments have been forced, therefore, to take the lead in dealing with this emergency.  Unfortunately, alone, no one state can restore a semblance of normal life within its borders while the virus rages in this country.  However, with concerted action and unity of purpose New England, New York, &amp; New Jersey possess the manpower, infrastructure, resources to restore a measure or security and prosperity to their people.  Once this is achieved the prospects for national success in controlling the epidemic will become infinitely better. ",1,1594955808,rhode_island,2020-07-16 21:16:48

A video of the meeting can be found [here](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/video/archives.php) under ""Re-open SC Children's Services, PPE Subcommittee"".

The board primarily focused on the testimony of Dr. Greenhouse's (51 minute mark), a pediatrician.  Her testimony centered around [this article](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/covid-19-planning-considerations-return-to-in-person-education-in-schools/) put out by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Dr. Greenhouse stated that 3 feet of distancing is adequate, there should be no required restrictions on elementary and middle school students, and the only appropriate restriction is a mask requirement for high schools.

State Superintendent of Education, Molly Spearman, provided testimony, primarily focusing on the problem of truancy and the logistical issues schools will face implementing [DEHEC's recommendations](https://www.scdhec.gov/sites/default/files/media/document/School_Operations_COVID-19_Interim%20Guidance-5.18.20.pdf).

I feel what was missing from the testimony was a discussion around the risk incurred by teachers and staff when reopening.  It should be noted that no active teachers gave testimony during the meeting.",1,1594260689,south_carolina,2020-07-08 20:11:29

For the full story, you need % positive + a date corrected graph. Both can be found on DHECs website.","The daily case count doesn’t tell the whole story. Let’s say 1,900 positive tests were reported today. 1,900 positive tests today is not the same as 1,900 new infections today. 

Of the 1,900 positive tests today, some of those were recent, some were from last week, some were from two weeks ago, etc. 

If 1,900 tests came back positive today, but 1,800 are from 2 weeks ago, that tells a totally different story than 1,900 new infections today. 

DHEC knows this and corrects for this problem by assigning cases to the date a person first showed symptoms. If that’s not available then they plug it in on the day the test came back positive. 

That’s also why DHECs graph shows at most 700 cases per day when we’ve been reporting well over 1,000 cases per day for the last several weeks.

We are researchers from Rowan University seeking to understand the mental health impact of COVID-19 and how individuals are struggling to cope during the pandemic. **Right now, our study is underrepresented from South Carolina (and the south east USA generally) so we are seeking out participants from that part of the country.** Anyone who is at least 18 years old, English speaking, and a resident of the United States is welcome to take part. This comprehensive survey is anticipated to take between 20 and 40 minutes to complete and **participants will be entered into a drawing for a chance to win a $100 Visa card. One out of every 25 participants will be randomly selected to win.** Participants will also have the option to be considered to participate in follow-up research that will result in further compensation.

coronavirusSC,ButterflyFew,Severe case of COVID-19,"Anyone here had a severe case of COVID-19, specifically where you were hospitalized? I was hospitalized with bilateral COVID pneumonia for a week and now recovering. It’s been such a surreal experience I’m having a little bit of hard time dealing with it and would love a support of some sort or someone who can relate...

I’m 46, healthy, never a smoker/drinker, no health issues. I did everything I was supposed to do - stay home, wash hands, don’t have people over, wear a mask, etc. - have absolutely no idea how I got it.

Started out with annoying dry cough, mild fever 99F°, then unreal body aches, got better, the started coughing again over the first 7 days. From Day 8 it went downhill with shortness of breaths, couldn’t carry on conversation by Day 10. Ended up in the hospital on Day 11. Got a plethora of antibiotics, steroids, anticoagulant, vitamins, and remdesivir. After 7 days I was discharged. Now at home “taking it easy” for 2 weeks now.

If you’re recovering from a similar case, have you ever felt like your lungs may be “relapsing”? Like today I started to cough again, that very similar dry cough that’s coming from my left lung that was a lot worse than right. Have anyone had the viral pneumonia come back??

I have a source who wishes to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation. They are reporting there is a Covid-19 outbreak at the Smyrna, TN Military base(Smyrna Airport) that is being covered up/hidden.

Cleaning crews are not being provided any protective gear and told there is no Covid-19 on the base.

Cleaning crews go to barracks and see soldiers holding up signs saying covid-19 positive quarantined do not enter.

When this information was brought to the cleaning crews leadership, they asked for protective gear, they are told; no, there is no covid-19 on the base and if they have a problem they can go home, with no pay.

&amp;#x200B;

Not-Covid-Related:

Same source has reported they have personally overheard other members of this base talking about how  embezzlement is going on. One example was furniture for the base was ordered, but they are directing it to soldier(s) homes instead.

&amp;#x200B;

My source feels going to News Channel 5 would be useless. Is there anyone else I/we should report this too? Can anyone who works/goes here speak up to corroborate this story?",22,1594745477,tennessee,2020-07-14 10:51:17

CoronavirusTN,WHYHRUDOINDAT,Question about small business assistance?,"So I own a small business that is seasonal in it's nature. As the owner/operator I am responsible for every aspect of the business. As of last Friday I began experiencing mild symptoms of covid-19. I went and got tested the next day and have been quarantining since. 

In the meantime I have had to cancel all of my work for two weeks out since my employees are more helpers, and not skilled enough to perform the work without me. Some customers have understood and we have postponed the work. Others have their own deadlines they must meet and have hired someone else to complete the job. I have probably missed out on a few thousand dollars this week alone, and if I test positive will surely miss out on more money over the next two weeks. My largest customer is likely to drop me also because of deadlines that are approaching. I am afraid I might not get them back which would be a major blow to my business.

Since my work is seasonal this is the busiest time of the year, and I am essentially sidelined. Even though a majority of my work takes place in a 4 month span, I still have bills that I must pay every month. I'm worried that I am not going to be able to recover from the loss, and will be forced to close my business. I called the department of revenue, but they said only businesses that were mandated to shut-down were eligible for loans. 

Is there any other program for sole-proprietors someone knows of that I can apply to for assistance. From what I have read everything seems designed to keep employees on payrolls, but I have seen nothing about sole-proprietors who might get sick and need assistance.",1,1594823547,tennessee,2020-07-15 08:32:27

From CNN's Maggie Fox

Following the Trump administration’s decision to reroute coronavirus hospital data first to the administration, instead of sending it to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some data is no longer available on the CDC.gov website. 

The information removed from the website is the hospital data that was reported to the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network, according to CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund.

The data includes...

the current inpatient and intensive care unit bed occupancy
Health care worker staffing
 Personal protective equipment supply status and availability

CoronavirusTN,TheVoiceInTheDesert,Questions on the costs of and related to testing.,"I work at a university that (to my knowledge) is not providing or sponsoring any COVID-19 testing. Students will need to go off-campus to a health care provider in order to get tested. Having heard stories of people getting billed hundreds of dollars for testing or related labwork/visits, I'm concerned that our students will wind up paying financially for these tests. 

I keep hearing the phrase that testing is free ""for all Tennessee residents"". Many of our young undergraduate students are still technically residents of their home state. If a student were to go to the health department for testing, would they be turned down if they do not have a TN identification, or are technically permanent residents of another state?

Additionally, the health department is some distance away from the university, and students are more likely to go to closer local health care offices. I have heard that several of the closest offices, having realized that the university is not testing, are preparing policies that would require students to see a provider and get billed for an office visit in order to receive testing for COVID-19. Is this legal?

This comprehensive survey is anticipated to take between 20 and 40 minutes to complete and **participants will be entered into a drawing for a chance to win a $100 Visa card. One out of every 25 participants will be randomly selected to win.** Participants will also have the option to be considered to participate in follow-up research that will result in further compensation.

Good Morning TN,

It has come to my attention that in Rutherford you CANNOT hand deliver your mail-in ballot. I keep seeing people posting that they can request mail in, and drop it off at the election commission office box or something along those lines (I hoped they would setup a drive through drop off there). Because people are worried about what is going on with the USPS (new boss slowing down deliveries). Looks like we cant in Rutherford, at least.

Please, check your local area's rules.",10,1595418769,tennessee,2020-07-22 05:52:49

I did one of these sorts of tables a few days ago and people seemed to like it. Previously I sorted by Daily Increase, but now I sort by a combination of increase and the population currently infected to create a sort of composite. (Here it's ratio_increase^5 * pct_population). I'm also leaving out counties that had fewer than 15 new cases in this table.

This is just one of many tables I fool around with. Obviously one day increases can have a lot of noise from day to day. The overall percent that have been infected is a more stable number. I also have tables of averages over various time periods and projections assuming current growth is maintained which I can share. If you want to see more columns, just ask. I could add the raw case numbers for example. Or if you don't like the sorting and have a better idea. I can post one of these every few days if people like them. And make simple changes. Complex changes will take more time. I'm working on some stuff along those lines.

Here's something I've been fiddling with: recent day trends in the number of Harvard-criteria green/yellow/orange/red counties. But based on that one day averages, not the official 15 day averages. So it's noisy from day to day. 15 day averages and maybe 5 and 10 for comparison I'll try to post later. Condition Red means more than 25 new daily cases per 100k population and it is recommended there be a complete shut down order to avoid catastrophe. Orange status is 10-25 daily new cases. Yellow is 1-9.

Note there was a massive drop from the 21st to the 22nd after the 21st hit stunning highs and then the 22nd's data was delayed for 3 hours while they adjusted it. It's clear what the results of the adjusting were. However even with the downward tweaks, huge numbers of counties in the short term are running above 10 above 15 above 25 cases per 100,000 per day. Which epidemiologists recommend shutting schools completely down, to shutting all society down. The data is showing that a tsunami or tornado isn't just coming it's hit. Seeking shelter is wise if your county isn't in the green or at least yellow. Unlike a tsunami or tornado that passes in at most a few hours we might be talking about sheltering for weeks or months.

CoronavirusTN,HildaMarin,Predicted Growth Tables for July 27,"Here's a new table that may be of interest. I take the increase over the last 7 days and apply it forward to the next 7 days, then sort it by which counties have the highest per-100k increase numbers, the things used for the red-yellow-green status. Now this projection depends on things continuing the way they are and we certainly hope things don't continue the way they are and the projection will be inaccurate because behaviors change in the meantime.

Now that's got to be inaccurate we hope.

Also we should note that in these tables the percentage infected by positive tests is about 1/10 that of the actual number of infected, according to a recent paper by the CDC. So you can multiply by 10 and get the ""actual"" percentage, and if that's more than 100% it's just 100% really, or close to it.

Now you might wonder, say, what if you apply your fancy projection to some time in the past and see if it worked or not. Well it does by and large. But there are counties that do better and do worse than the projection. I call that the Deviance from Projection. And I got some tables for those too.

# July 27 projected cases using 7-day average from July 20:

First we have some counties that did better than predicted. Maybe something changed. If you're in one of these maybe you know something. Perhaps a mask order was issued. Or something shut down. Or people got more serious.

# Best Difference:

  County   | Projected | Actual | Divergence per 100k
---------- | --------- | ------ | -------------------
     Giles |       351 |    273 |     -38
Williamson |      3385 |   2943 |     -27
 Henderson |       368 |    320 |     -25
   Stewart |        81 |     59 |     -24
    Wilson |      2101 |   1876 |     -23
 Trousdale |      1576 |   1561 |     -20
   Chester |       177 |    155 |     -19
    Carter |       389 |    318 |     -18
   Fayette |       588 |    541 |     -17
     Moore |        44 |     37 |     -17
    Shelby |     19696 |  18654 |     -16
   Hancock |        74 |     68 |     -15
Montgomery |      1669 |   1455 |     -15
  Davidson |     18831 |  18136 |     -14
  Sullivan |       735 |    598 |     -12

Next is the opposite. These did worse than the prediction. Well the top one we have been talking a lot about here lately so that makes sense. The mayors are against masks, everything is open, they are having proms and graduations with big crowds of people with no masks. Yeah they are accelerating. So these divergence tables might work to tell us something. If you're from some of these other counties in this table and it makes sense or doesn't feel free to share.

CoronavirusTN,HildaMarin,Top Positivity Rates for July 28,"Positivity Rate is the number of positive test results divided by the total number of tests given. The rule of thumb is you want your positivity rate to be around 5% if you can rely on your numbers. (Having fast test turnaround is also necessary to be able to rely on numbers and that is another problem.) As your positivity rate gets higher than 5%, you miss more and more cases and need more testing to catch up with them.

Using a 7 day average of recent results, 68 Tennessee counties have positivity rates higher than 5%. 23 counties have rates higher than 10%. These counties all most certainly have infection rates significantly higher than reported.

CoronavirusTN,HildaMarin,Highest weekly spread + Most Infected Populace for August 2,"This first table is top increases over the last week. The leaders in this list changes quite a bit from week to week. If your county is here, your county needs to make changes. It seems that when counties have a high rate of increase they are more likely to stay home and mandate masks and the numbers go down. But if your county stays in various top lists for day after day and week after week then you have real problems. This list also shows emerging hot spots. The total % infected is important too. High numbers of population plus large increases is bad. But if large numbers are infected already, we can expect the increase to go down at some point, but it's still bad since more people are infected.

This shows which counties have the most people infected per capita. I don't account for ""recoveries"" since the criteria we use is questionable since it's not determined via a test to tell if the person is either infectious or cured. Also considerably more people are infected at any given moment than are the known number, the multiplier is said by the CDC to be 10x on average. Assuming though that the incidence rate is the actual number, I also show what are the chances in each county that at least one person is infected in a room with 100 people like a church, 25 people, like a store early in the morning, or 10 people such as a back yard BBQ. As you can see the chances are surprisingly high in these counties with infection rates of 1% and above. This is relevant because there are numerous ""super-spreader"" events where *one person* came to a crowded event and infected large numbers of people there.

I don't believe there has been an official announcement of entering Phase 3. MTSU did announce on Friday that Scholars Academy would be offered remotely and the STAR program canceled due to COVID.

&gt;  
&gt;This includes the resumption of on-campus instruction as prescribed, full services as required, and moving toward full operations.  
&gt;  
&gt;This phase will be informed by guidance from health professionals and in compliance with guidelines and directives of federal and state governing agencies.

Courses are still 40% remote, 40% hybrid, 20% online.

Situation: I’m self employed, have been all year. From April 1 - May 1, I was out of work due to client shutdown. When that happened, I tried multiple times over the span of a few weeks to apply for unemployment. The issue is I didn’t have a computer and was using my phone browser - and you can imagine how well that went. I’d get to the last section of the application and it would just... crash my phone and not save any of my application. In June, I attempted to retroactively apply, but on a computer, and again, the entire browser just crashed and lost everything when I got to the submission part. At that point, I just gave up out of frustration and figured I’d just die. I needed the money but was technically still okay financially.

Well I didn’t just die, and I’m now - again - out of work temporarily due to me and my clients being quarantined for separate exposures. I now desperately need that month of unemployment from spring.

So overall question - Can I still retroactively apply for UI from April - May?

CoronaVirusTX,CosmicM00se,Testing in Tx is a JOKE!,"We are north of Houston. My husband was around someone on the 18th who tested positive a few days later. When he found out, we started trying to find somewhere to get him tested. 

This proved to be fucking impossible! 

No doctors offices had tests and all said to call the 211 hotline thing. That was a joke. So we looked on their website at testing centers. Called them all and they all required appointments and were days out, and not doing them on the weekends. He finally got through to someone on this past Monday and got in for a test at a CVS in The Woodlands this morning (Wednesday). Because the tests take 2-4 days and Friday-Sun won’t count, they said he might know results by Thursday of next week. 

Thankfully, he’s not showing symptoms and it’s been 2 weeks since possible exposure. By 17 year old son was feeling a little sick so we tried to get him tested too but the location my husband was going to said no one under 18 could be tested there. Wtf!? 

It has just all been SO FRUSTRATING! I’m taking care of my 80+ yr old grandmother as best and as often I can so we have to careful. With our experience with testing, I wouldn’t doubt if the case numbers are at least 5x what we are seeing reported. There is ZERO urgency to have people tested in TX. It’s like no one gives a flying shit anymore. 

We want schools to open back up! Let’s freaking get this testing crap under control. If more people are tested and we can see that a TRUE majority of positive cases are not that extreme, then maybe the caution could be toned down a little. But we don’t know ANYTHING because since the beginning the testing in Texas, in this entire country, has been an absolute joke! Now with Trump wanting to pull back on testing I guess we are all just freaking screwed and we will never know the full extent of the virus. Without proper data we don’t know WTF is going on and they refuse to let us participate in gathering that data by flat out telling us not to get tested, to just stay at home for 2 weeks. 

If y’all are in the Houston area and found testing easier than we did, please give a heads up. We were both on the phone for hours trying to figure crap out so that my husband could get back to the office. Thankfully, his colleagues are cool with him working from home until he gets results, but it isn’t ideal. And thank goodness our kids never started feeling too bad. I guess you have to be unable to breath before they pay attention to you. I know the hospitals are overrun and crazy right now, I appreciate the medical professionals doing all they can.

CoronaVirusTX,theotheryellowperil,Friends went from taking this seriously to denying they are part of the problem,"For context, I’m part of a hobby improv group that used to meet regularly and would socialize outside of gigs/practice. Naturally, that ground to a halt when COVID hit. At least at first.

For the first few months, everyone was on the same page. We’d talk on social media or through group chats, we found virtual ways to meet or practice, wore masks on the rare occasions we had to venture out, encouraged each other to stay at home. Some of the more outgoing people were upset about not being able to see everyone, but we all agreed the risks were not worth trying to visit each other. 

It’s like someone flipped a switch in May. One person is seriously celebrating being COVID negative with a party. As soon as the SAH orders lifted, a bunch of the group met at an absolutely packed festival. They swore up and down they would socially distance, but of course they were hugging and posing for pictures the first time they saw each other. They just awkwardly laughed about how they couldn’t manage to keep to safety guidelines with friends and never spoke about it again. They continued to complain about other people not socially distancing in public. 

Since then, they’ve been meeting regularly for practice. Indoors. Without masks (apparently it’s too hard to practice that way). Barely 6 feet apart, if that (not that 6 feet is a magic COVID barrier in itself, it’s just a minimum distance recommendation). And of course the places they’re meeting aren’t regularly sanitized.

My group chat is exploding with invites to parties, posts about people’s vacations, and more rehearsal/practice times. They’re starting to take gigs again. I tried bringing up how this might be an issue once and they themselves will sometimes talk about how they’re maybe taking too many risks. The responses range from “well I’m wearing a mask to the store” to “mind your business” to “we’re following minimum CDC guidelines” to “well we’re all probably going to get it eventually”. Note the same people frequently get into social media arguments about how selfish and ignorant people are being by attending big events and generally not taking COVID seriously.

I’m just frustrated at this point. If I end up kicked out of the hobby because I’m not showing up for gigs or practice, that’s fine, I’d rather that than be dead. But it feels like I’m losing friends in the dumbest possible way. They read the same articles I do, they’ve been looking at the same numbers. They know how contagious this is. I know because they will use the same information for social media points. No amount of statistics seems to convince them that they’re part of the problem. If I even suggest that at this point, I’ll end up losing more friends. 

Not sure if anyone else is experiencing this phenomenon with people or if I lucked out. 

I just don't get people.",1,1593709570,texas,2020-07-02 11:06:10

CoronaVirusTX,R0amingGn0me,Families First Coronavirus Response Act: Employee Paid Leave Rights,"*Long*

TLDR: Work made me think it was ok to WFH while in quarantine and then told me there was a company wide rule prohibiting anyone to work from home and that I would have to use vacation/sick pay during my time off which I found is out is only kind of true. 

Our Houston office is really small, less than 10 people. 

When this all started, we worked from home for a few months but then we back to the office. (Relevant later)

This past Monday I started to feel chills and a sore throat by the end of the day and by 2 am Tuesday I woke up having sweat through my clothes and sheets and worse sore throat - I knew I was definitely sick then. 

At 7 am, I went to pick up my work stuff from the office so I could work from home and wore a mask in the office and wiped everything down with disinfectant wipes on my way out. 

I texted my bosses at 730 am to let them know that I was sick and would be working from home for 2 weeks. They both said that it was fine and to keep them updated so they could take precautions for the rest of the staff. 

On Tuesday I received a text from one of them with a link to a CVS testing center. I told them that I was not comfortable going to a Houston testing site because I've heard of insurances being charged crazy amounts for tests and if you have to pay up front it's $100+ which I don't have and I can't afford any surprise Medical bills. 

I let them know that I had already booked an appointment with a fort bend county site because that is where I'm a resident but it's not until this coming Monday. I know for a fact that these tests are free for county residents. 

Then I received a text yesterday with a different link from a different boss telling me I could get a sooner test and I explained to that boss about not having the money to pay up front and not trusting that the Houston testing site wouldn't charge my insurance. 

I was wondering why they were pushing for me to test so quickly....

This morning as I was catching up on emails and talking to my boss about work, they insist that I take the day off and not work from home. I told them that I was feeling fine enough to work but they really insisted that I wouldn't be able to do my work because I wasn't ""at 100%"". I reiterated that I felt fine enough to work and that's when I was told that there's a company wide rule prohibiting ANYONE in the company from working from home. 

When I pointed out that we worked from home for a few months with no issues, they told me that it didn't matter and we closed the whole office which is why everyone was permitted to work from home and that they could not bend the rules for me because if they did then they'd have to change the rules for everyone. 

This is the first time that I have every heard of this ""rule"". We do not have a rule/policy book and I did not sign any paperwork stating any of that. 

I told them that I could not afford to take 2 whole weeks off of work. That's so much money to be out and it will be hell for me to come in and pick up where I left off but they would not budge and even disabled my remote access to my work computer. 

I was told that I would have to stay home for the full 2 weeks while I waited for my results and during that time I would have to use my vacation/sick hours and that only if my test comes back positive will they reimburse me for my time that I have taken off. (This is not exactly true, see below).


So I decided to see if what they were saying was true and this is what I found:

https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-employee-paid-leave

Families First Coronavirus Response Act: Employee Paid Leave Rights

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA or Act) requires certain employers to provide employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. The Department of Labor’s (Department) Wage and Hour Division (WHD) administers and enforces the new law’s paid leave requirements. These provisions will apply from the effective date through December 31, 2020.

Generally, the Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:

Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at the employee’s regular rate of pay where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), and/or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis;


I even called the Houston division of the Labor Department to confirm and she told me that my company is required to pay me for 80 hours max while I'm waiting for the results whether they come back positive or negative. 

I want to point out that she told me it would depend on the ""orders"" that I received from work. I did not receive any ""orders"" or instructions on how to proceed from my company. 

My test is on Monday, the results will probably take a week to come in. If it comes back negative, I'll be permitted back to work. If it comes back positive, my work could order me to stay home for 2 weeks starting from that date and only be required to pay me for the 80 total hours from the first 2 weeks and I'd have to use my vacation for the rest. 

I wanted to post my experience through this whole thing and post the information that I found during my search. 

I'm really just venting as I am frustrated with how my work is handling this and the lack of communication. 

I understand their rules but I just wish that I had been told all of this up front so I could have prepared myself financially in case of this happening. 

I didn't know that they were required to pay for 80 hours while I am in quarantine whether the results were positive or negative as that is not what they company told me. 

I hope this information helps someone.",1,1593731299,texas,2020-07-02 17:08:19

I thought I’d drive by the beach to see how many people were out.

One cop was guarding a gate to the beach and another one was blocking an entrance for an empty parking lot that normally at this time of year is filled with cars. The beaches are closed for car access but unfortunately people are still allowed onto the beach if they walk. There are thick barricades to entrances not guarded by police too. The good thing I can see is that there definitely are less people on the beaches since having to walk is dissuading people, but there are still a lot of groups of people out there, and I noticed the groups forming are larger just because people don’t seem to want to walk too far, but then again I didn’t see just how filled or empty the beach was since I just drove by and took a quick look. Since parking is limited they’re now parking along side the road toward the beach, there were a lot of cars, but it didn’t compare to how many cars you would normally see on the actual beach when they’re allowed. Since all of our beaches are usually accessed by car I can see this having a big positive impact.",13,1593802080,texas,2020-07-03 12:48:00

CoronaVirusTX,NymeriaofRhoyne,Things That Keep Me Up At Night As A Texas Teacher,"Things That Keep Me Up At Night As A Texas Teacher

Like many educators, no one has asked me about the upcoming year. So, I thought I would share with you.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Texas has not flattened the curve. [Cases are increasing exponentially](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states/texas) due to community spread that is well beyond test, trace, and isolate. Right now, there is no end in sight and the [Texas Medical Center, the largest medical center in the world, is approaching surge capacity.](https://www.tmc.edu/coronavirus-updates/tmc-2-week-projection-using-bed-occupancy-growth/)
2. TEA is currently requiring schools to open in person to receive funding.[""On-campus instruction must be offered for all students who want to attend on campus in order to be eligible to receive funding for remote instruction.""](https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/17b577568cb472a9b4878e40c186af9a/SY-20-21-Attendance-and-Enrollment-FAQ.pdf)
3. Outbreaks in daycares show us that community spread between young people and educators is already happening in Texas. [""As of Tuesday, there were 950 reported positive cases of COVID-19 — 307 children and 643 staff members — at 668 child care locations.”](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/01/texas-day-care-coronavirus-cases-rising/) There are also many more reports of outbreaks from camps and athletics that have been in session this Summer.
4. [79 NYC teachers died of COVID-19.](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/about-us/news/covid-19-losses) One of the first deaths was [this 36 year old principal.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/coronavirus-death-brooklyn-school-principal.html) By returning to school, we are accepting sacrificing more educators. Students could also be traumatized as staff fall critically ill or die.
5. [The preliminary draft of the TEA Public Health Planning Guide does not provide mandates for easy, research based preventative practices that are mandated in other indoor buildings.](https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/2a599efa6176b07606b12f27ea1c586d/covid-19-SY-20-21-Public-Health-Guidance.pdf?_ga=2.130676495.1259460859.1593781868-673451962.1592539141) In regard to social distancing it says, ""Where feasible without disrupting the educational experience, encourage students to practice social distancing... In classroom spaces that allow it, consider placing student desks a minimum of six feet apart when possible.“ It also appears parents can choose if their child should wear a mask. The document reads, ”...consider having students for whom it is developmentally appropriate wear masks or face shields at times when they will be in close proximity to other students for an extended period (i.e., when they would otherwise meet the definition of a close contact)…. For students in first grade and above, the determination of whether wearing a mask is developmentally appropriate is up to the student’s parent or guardian.” 
6. Currently, teachers are incentivized and penalized to not miss days and only have a few personal days. This will potentially cause staff that have been exposed or are showing symptoms to still come to work and spread it to more students and staff or face the repercussions of poor evaluations, no pay, and/or losing their job.
7. [School staff shortages are already a problem.](https://tea.texas.gov/reports-and-data/educator-data/educator-reports-and-data) Already, many high needs schools have to hire substitutes to cover classes for the year because they cannot find a full time teacher to hire. Paraeducators, cafeteria workers, custodians, bus drivers, and subs are also important components of the school system. They make approximately minimum wage, by the hour, and have little to no benefits. With the increased risk in the Fall, many will find other jobs- exasperating shortages that already exist. No school can properly function without these staff.
8. Teachers can lose their certification if they do not resign 45 days before the first day of instruction. Most school districts have not released their plans for the Fall yet and that window has closed for many educators. [""Teachers are required to resign a contract no later than 45 days before the first day of instruction. A district may release a teacher voluntarily after that date, but is not compelled to do so. A teacher who is found to have abandoned a contract without good cause may have his/her certificate suspended by the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC).""](https://tea.texas.gov/about-tea/contact-us/general-inquiry)
9. Texas Teachers legally cannot strike to fight for what is best for them, their colleagues, and students. [Even discussing striking can result in teachers losing their job, their licensure, and their pension.](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/05/texas-public-school-teachers-strike-union-oklahoma/)
10. And to top it all off- [We still have to give the STAAR test and have teacher evaluations in the Spring](https://www.statesman.com/news/20200630/coronavirus-or-not-texas-students-must-take-staar-in-2020-21). This is already a very anxiety inducing experience for many kids. I couldn’t imagine giving it during a pandemic. I guess the silver lining is we don’t have to collect test materials that students have anxiety-vomited on and send them to TEA anymore. ""[TEA is changing its policy on the collection of test booklets and answer documents that have human contaminants (e.g., vomit, blood, other bodily fluids, etc.). Districts will no longer be required to return these test booklets and/or answer documents to the contractor.""](https://www4.esc13.net/uploads/assessment/docs/2018_STAAR_DCCM_tagged(1).pdf)

If you got this far- thank you for listening! It seems no one else has. If you’re willing to go one more step- please email Mike Morath at [commissioner@tea.texas.gov](mailto:commissioner@tea.texas.gov). It doesn’t have to be long. Something like…

Dear Commissioner, 

Please let me know what you are doing to ensure the safety and well being of school staff and students for the upcoming school year. I am especially concerned about…

CoronaVirusTX,rwaterbury,Lives put at risk in halfway house in Houston.,"I received an alarming call from my brother yesterday regarding a serious life threatening health risk that he and other inmates at a local halfway house are being compelled to endure. This what he sent:

""On Wed. the 1st of July 2020 the management at the Leidel Center located at 1819 Commerce Street Houston Texas released the covid-19 positive inmates, that were in quarantine, back into general population without testing them before release. The security staff told the us(the prisoners) that the positive prisoners were no longer contagious because they had been in quarantine for fourteen days. Knowing that the illness can continue in some patients for longer than a month, I knew we were being put at risk. All of them were transferred to D unit, where I am currently, which until today was free of covid-19. Some of those transferred still appear to be sick. I have contacted the health departments of the city, county, and state. I was told that ""they do not deal with such severe violations"" but could not tell me who did. I also called the police because it seems like putting our lives at risk in this way should be illegal.  I was told that they could not help us.""

And he sent me the text of the personal account of one of the inmates he is with that contracted the virus.  Here it is:

""My name is Eddie and this is my covid 19 story. I had already been sick for a week and a half when I realized I was just too sick and I desperately needed medical attention. I went and spoke to my case manager Miss Hunt. She told me to go to the front desk and wait for the ambulance to get to the facility to get picked up. When I went to the front waiting area in the Leidel Residential Reentry Center I was told that I could not get an ambulance because I was not sick enough and they were not willing to pay for the ambulance. With no other recourse I called my father and asked him to come and pick me up. He came and brought me to hospital. After two days in hospital I was stabilized and my father picked me up and brought me back to the halfway house. Two days later he got sick with the virus. On 07-02-2020 my father called me and told me that he could not breath and needed an ambulance. I immediately called the ambulance for my father who speaks little English. He is currently in hospital struggling to stay alive. This is my uncut and unedited true story. The Leidel Center is playing God and gambling with our lives and the lives of our families and loved ones.""",17,1593828686,texas,2020-07-03 20:11:26

I kept my mask on at the store, frequently washed my hands and sanitized, and wiped down my phone every time. 

I decided to get tested because on the 19th of June I had diarrhea and acid reflux vomit. After that I felt completely fine to this day. What do you think would be the chance of me having the virus? My family are gonna want to hug me (we're a six person household with several dogs), so should I still have a mask on? What about for the trip back?

Here in Canada, 80% of our deaths were in nursing homes despite banning visitors early on. It's not just to keep the elderly alive, you need to save the nursing homes otherwise the influx of residents can quickly overwhelm the hospitals. 

Staff need to be in full PPE all the time, have all residents dining in their own rooms, residents who see each other need to wear masks, isolate and test everyone at the first sign of illness, and staff need to be banned from working in multiple homes. Test all residents and staff regularly, and staff need a good sick leave policy so they can be encouraged to stay home if they don't feel well. The home I was deployed to lost 1/3 of their residents before the outbreak was contained, those people would still be alive if we adopted those measures earlier.

CoronaVirusTX,roboteye,Employer refusing to comply with mask mandate. What recourse do I have as an employee?,"I am the director, but not owner, of a retail store in North Texas. I arrived at work today to deliver a package of masks that I had purchased to give to the employees to find that none of the employees were wearing masks (although most customers seemed to be complying).

I called the owner, who informed me that the text of the executive order only requires masks for individuals within six feet of one another. Of course, all the employees, namely the cashiers, are within a foot or two of each other. Clearly this was just an excuse for non compliance. When I pushed the issue, the owner told me to keep my opinions to myself and stop trying to control the actions of others. Another director stopped by after I left and had a more direct conversation with the employees, during which all employees claimed that they would not be wearing masks and belittled the other director.

I have a preexisting autoimmune health condition that the owner is well aware of, and I no longer feel safe in my workplace. I am, of course worried about optics: certain people will stop shopping here due to non compliance, while others will use our example as an excuse to stop wearing masks. 

What is my best course of action if the employees and the owner refuse to comply?

If I demand full time work from home, and my employer refuses, will I still be entitled to unemployment benefits? On a similar note, if I simply stop showing up/quit due to unsafe conditions, will I be able to collect unemployment?

I am also looking to report the violation, but I am not confident that local authorities will do much, and of course, I fear retaliation from my employer. Is there a reporting body beyond the local county authorities, or do I need to start there?",36,1593890462,texas,2020-07-04 13:21:02

Since the bad news is pretty self explanatory in the charts, I noticed one good piece of news that is buying us a little time. This comment is related only to the charts, not medical improvements, politics, etc.

The total number of COVID patients in ICU and Med Surge beds are each increasing (bad news), but the *total* ICU numbers are staying below the 100%. These were much higher early last week.

The difference between the two is non-COVID patients. This means the freeze on many elective surgeries (from a couple of weeks ago) is starting to show up in the numbers. Think of it like a race between keeping non-COVID patients out of ICU to stay ahead of the increase in COVID patients. So we (our hard fighting medical system) are winning the race but COVID is catching up quickly and we are still losing the battle.

Bottom line, they are successfully buying time, even if just a few days. Take win for a day, stay safe, and happy Monday!",8,1594056299,texas,2020-07-06 11:24:59

CoronaVirusTX,mcmegan6,Businesses Refusing Service?,"DFW area people:

Would you like to know which businesses are refusing service for not wearing a mask?  Please message me through comment or private message if you can add to this master list.  

Backstory:  While at Walgreens yesterday, I was checking out when two middle-aged men entered the store without a mask. Everyone I saw during my shopping trip had a mask on. These two men chose to cut through between the two check stands 2 feet away from me instead of entering the store and avoiding me. Their body language and facial expression led me to assume they were looking for a fight about wearing a mask. The cashier seemed intimidated and only said, ”Welcome to Walgreens”.

I called the store today and found out the official store policy is to encourage masks with signs on the front door, but employees were not allowed to confront customers or refuse service.  I called the CVS as well, and they have the same policy.  Both store managers were frustrated, but had to follow corporate policy.

I don’t have time or the will to call every business and ask about enforcement, so I’m asking for your help.  I’m not trying to sway your opinion one way or another on the issue.  I would like to have a go to list so I can shop in places that align with my thought process on the issue.  

If you don’t want to wear a mask, you’ll know where to go.  If you want to wear one and want others around you wear one as well, you’ll know where to go.

I’ll post a link to the google sheet below once I get it started.

CoronaVirusTX,allinoneprinterink,how do y'all feel about dining in at a restaurant?,"I manage a small restaurant with about 10 employees.
We currently have a 50/50 mix of take out/dining customers.

We get a wide range of customers ranging from single parties reluctantly dining in on their short lunch break to large groups who demand they sit together with no masks on. Some customers have left gigantic tips for the staff, some people have left cursing out the staff complaining about masks or max capacities. 

My question is, if you have dined in at a restaurant after the reopening began, what were your expectations on the restaurants safety measures against the pandemic?

For example, all our staff wear masks and gloves at ALL times when they are inside the restaurant. They wash their hands frequently and body temperatures are measured before they enter the restaurant everyday. The dine in tables are 6ft apart and maximum capacity of 50% is strictly enforced. This is about all we can do.

However, they do not use a new glove for every single table, the restrooms are not sanitized every minute (we clean every hour), and not every single surface that customers touch are sanitized completely. We simply do not have the manpower necessary to be a 100% safe. 

Sanitizers, gloves, masks, soap, towels, and all the other personal protective equipment cost a significant amount of money. Even worse, placing more servers per shift comes at the employees' cost due to the fact that 99% of their wages come from customer tips. This dilemma prevents me from having enough staff in the front to take all the safety measures.

I guess what im trying to say is that its not safe to dine in and I don't know if the customers are aware. It is impossible to guarantee 100% safety. 

Everyday I drive to work, I feel conflicted about serving and making food for our customers. Even if the customers coming in are aware of the risks, it does not mean I, or the restaurant is not responsible if anybody gets sick from dining at our restaurant.

The problem is that after I get to work and I feel guilty about accepting dine in customers, we reach maximum capacity within 30 minutes and most of them seem to not care at all.

I'm just sitting here blabbering about my problems but I hope, even just one person, reads this post and reconsiders going out for lunch or dinner at a restaurants. Its not safe. Take out is much safer. If there is one thing that i learned from this pandemic, its that people as individuals, are unpredictable and for the most part cannot be trusted. If the demands for in person interactions decrease, the supply will respond accordingly. We can move on without causing so many casualties.  Remember what you are risking. For one meal.

CoronaVirusTX,roboteye,"UPDATE: Employer refused to comply with mask mandate. Now we have a confirmed positive case, and still no compliance.","[Link to previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronaVirusTX/comments/hl8zo2/employer_refusing_to_comply_with_mask_mandate/)

A few days ago I posted about my North Texas retail employer refusing to enforce the mask mandate. You all gave me some great advice; I have contacted the local law enforcement and health authorities, and made a formalized complaint to management. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to have gone very far.

I contacted the owner of the business yesterday in the morning to check on mask compliance. He informed me that the cashiers and other staff were now wearing masks when customers were in the building. In the late afternoon, during the owner's lunch break, I stepped into the building to see for myself. Here is what I saw:

* Congested counter area with 2 unmasked cashiers and 2 unmasked customers; maybe 2 feet of space between each person
* Unmasked IT personnel working near the high-traffic area
* Unmasked customers throughout the store
* Unmasked general manager hiding like a frightened mouse in her office
* Department head with mask hanging from her ear, speaking to a customer who had pulled his own mask off his face - to top it off, they were trying on hats

After spying all this, I approached the owner again with my concerns. At this point he informed me that the situation is actually worse than it looks, because a cashier who interacts with the entire staff came to work sick on Saturday, and today received positive test results for Covid-19.

Here's the ultimate kicker: the owner wants compliance. He asked the employees to wear masks following the positive Covid case, but they all took their masks off when he left the building. He's dug his own grave. He has spent many weeks talking shit about masks and mask wearers, resulting in an anti-mask sentiment that he can't shake. He encouraged me to call the authorities and even invited me to reprimand/fire the employees (I do marketing, this is not part of my job).

The general manager and the owner are of the opinion that they cannot force the staff to wear masks. The owner is terrified of having his entire staff quit. The general manager is more worried about word getting on the street about our positive case, and wanted to keep going mask-free because so many customers had ""thanked"" her for allowing them to take their masks off in our store. The owner is a tired old man; the GM is an uneducated hick who would rather make nice than save lives.

As for me? I have demanded furlough for the time being. Today I make my formalized complaint to OSHA. I will resign from the board of directors in front of our HR representative on Friday, and I will be resigning from the job entirely on Monday morning. I suspect I will be invited back to my job when we have half a shift due to Covid running rampant throughout our staff.",2,1594216845,texas,2020-07-08 08:00:45

CoronaVirusTX,Cyclosarin88,Letter from UIL Director of Athletics,"Athletic Directors and Head Coaches,

The UIL is releasing revisions to the COVID-19 risk mitigation guidelines for summer strength and conditioning/skill development. This updated guidance is effective immediately until the first day of instruction or the start of in-season activities, whichever is earlier.

For complete details please see the UIL website, but updates are briefly summarized below:

Face Coverings – Executive Order GA-29
All employees, parents, visitors and students ten years of age or older must wear face coverings or face shields upon entry to an area where UIL activities are being conducted and when not actively practicing or exercising, unless an exception applies, as outlined in the full document
Students may access locker rooms and engage in drills that involve one or more students on offense against one or more students on defense beginning 7/13/20
Updates of required protocol for individuals confirmed, suspected or exposed to COVID-19
Additionally, the previously announced “Period of no Activity” dates of July 20-21, 2020 have been rescinded, allowing schools to open facilities to student-athletes. 

As the public health situation changes, and/or if subsequent Executive Orders are issued by the Office of the Governor, these guidelines may be further modified. Schools should carefully review this guidance, as well as information released by TEA, when re-evaluating local plans for reducing the risk of spreading the virus. Schools should consider their local context related to the virus and plan accordingly.

At this time, UIL plans to begin fall competition seasons as scheduled on the UIL calendar. UIL will continue to work with state officials and monitor CDC and other federal guidance to determine any further modifications to this guidance. 

Once again, thank you for your continued leadership and adaptability as we work together to keep our communities and students safe. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us with any questions or concerns you may have.

Thank you, 
Susan Elza, Ed.D.

&gt; ""If they’re feeling well, I’m not sure how much it’s worthwhile getting tested because if they’re positive, but feeling well, I will quarantine them. Even though they’re feeling fine, they’ll be home for 14 days.""  Dr. James Mobley, the health authority for San Patricio County

I can't believe I read that.  Quarantine is EXACTLY why testing is worthwhile, jackass! 

Getting COVID-positive people quarantined is one of the most effective ways of slowing down the spread of the disease.  But instead of doing his job and learning about epidemiology during a pandemic, the health authority not only maintains his ignorance, but also spreads it around his community with the voice of authority.  No wonder some people say, ""don't get tested, they won't let you work.""  That's their biggest concern, is 2 weeks salary.  Not knowing whether their cold symptoms should be taken seriously.  Not possibly killing their old neighbor, colleague, or customer.  Not people sitting in an ambulance for 8 hours waiting to get into the ER, just to not get in after all.

Maybe I'm just confused.  Maybe asymptomatic spread really is rare.  (Note:  ""asymptomatic"" means the person **never gets** symptoms, not just that they feel well now.)  Maybe most of these ""feeling well"" people never will get symptoms, they have the virus but not the disease, they aren't contributing to community spread.  But it sure seems that lots of people have allergies these days.  That can mask the symptoms of COVID-19.  Maybe these ""feeling well"" people are sicker than they think and are spreading the disease around like wildfire.",1,1594301792,texas,2020-07-09 07:36:32

CoronaVirusTX,toddisOK,Briefly encouraged...then lost all hope.,"Oklahoman here.  I work in DFW, but I haven't been in state since my job moved us to WFH in March.  I came into town yesterday to check on my property in Denton.  I stopped at Wal-Mart and was pleased to see that they are requiring masks, have a sanitation station inside the front door and have designated directions for each aisle.  This gave me hope that Texas is finally taking the right measures.

Then I started counting the number of employees and customers who did not have their mask covering their nose.  I stopped counting after 25.  Apparently there is a school of thought that says respiratory viruses can only be contracted through the mouth.  The lady who got in line behind me just had the damn thing resting on her chin with no intent of trying to cover anything!

Between the anti-maskers and the people with no common sense, I think it's safe to say Texas is fucked.",14,1594319500,texas,2020-07-09 12:31:40

CoronaVirusTX,phrresehelp,To those who want to augment their HVAC systems to filter the virus keep this in mind,"Keep in mind that many HVAC systems were not built to handle a hepa style filter. At most they were designed to handle Merv 14.  Anything higher HEPA is Merv 18 will place strain on the motor and might burn out the HVAC motor resulting in costly repair during the peak summer season.  

If you do want whole house HEPA in HVAC then there are addons being sold that come with their own specifically designed motors and enclosures that go inline with hour HVAC unit.  

Also for those of you considering adding uvc lights inline with the HVAC duct please make sure to read up on it and make sure that the light is coated so it won't produce ozone.  Otherwise you are exposing yourself to a very oxidative agent and it is very unhealthy for folks with breathing problems (hence the summer air quality alerts.... They are based of ozone concentrations).   Also, read up on the airflow treatment capability of the UVC light since most non commercial home HVAC units are not powerful enough to treat the air at regular HVAC flowrates they are built to keep mold off the condenser coil and not act as an antiviral whole house cleaner.

I was in a bad car accident last year and have been going in several days a week for many therapies after sustaining a brain injury that's deeply impacted my life. 

At the clinic I go to, it's not really being taken seriously, even though they have a sign out front saying that all staff and patients must wear masks. The staff either don't wear a mask at all, have it dangling off of one ear, don't have it properly covering the nose, have it under the chin etc. Even the doctor is usually not wearing a mask. Next to zero of the patients are wearing masks, and are not social distancing. I am nervous because there are very few good concussion clinics and certified chiropractors who can adjust the upper neck. I have been making progress recovering from a syndrome that is devastating and potentially permanent, so I don't want to stop going if possible, but I'm terrified and don't know what to do. I know if I don't get concentrated care my condition will start reverting. I've in a roundabout way expressed my concerns and it's the usual dismissive stuff.

This is in Denton county. Is there any sort of way to report this sort of thing? People like stroke victims go there so I find it very dangerous.",1,1594351396,texas,2020-07-09 21:23:16

TMC Updates for today. I've been trying to squeeze out some good news on my last of these, but running out of lipstick.

\- New hospitalizations are steady; both ICU and Med Surge are up. Almost 50% of people in ICU right now are COVID related. 

\- Projected ""unsustainable surge capacity"" is still around 13 days. I suspect this is because of the recent volatility over the holiday that disrupted the smooth curve. If so, the forecast is less accurate until we have a few days of steady data.  

\- Regarding New Hospitalizations while total occupancy is increasing: Hospitalizations are tied to the intake process. Intake is overwhelmed right now. Other articles have referenced ambulances lining up waiting to bring patients in and the number of dead-on-arrivals being reported by ambulances arriving at the scene is increasing. So people aren't making it to the hospital beds as fast as they are showing up.",1,1594403889,texas,2020-07-10 11:58:09

CoronaVirusTX,boredtxan,Please help with the disinfectant wipes shortage!,"I haven't been able to get my hands on a package of disinfectant wipes since February and I haven't been able to purchase lysol or pinesol in weeks.  I think we all need to reconsider how we are using our disinfectants and ensure that we are not just wasting them.  I think by and large we are using them wrong to comfort ourselves.  However, the shortage is severe and as offices open and schools (potentially) open, these products need to become more widely available and production currently can't keep up.  They are also essential for hospitals.

**The people who REALLY need them are those with active infections - it worries me greatly that this group can't purchase this much needed item.  They don't have much energy and need the convenience more than the rest of us.**

It isn't necessary to wipe down your groceries and you are probably not actually disinfecting them with wipes:   [https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/23/health/groceries-takeout-coronavirus-wellness-scn-trnd/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/23/health/groceries-takeout-coronavirus-wellness-scn-trnd/index.html)

For my Kirkland wipes (and they are stronger than most), the item needs to remain ***visibly wet*** for at least 15 seconds to actually disinfect. I've seen some brands instruct several minutes if they are more dilute.  This would result in a huge amount of wipes being used to get through a load of groceries.  I live in a moderately dry climate and nothing stays wet more than 30 seconds max. 

There are alternatives if cleaning groceries is important for you that will reduce dependence on wipes and actually accomplish your disinfection goals.   

 1.  Let groceries you don't need right away (that don't need refrigeration) sit somewhere for a few days.  Just wait for any virus to die basically.

2. Scrub sealed plastic groceries with warm water and soap. Rinse well and dry.  This works great with  items like milk cartons, yogurt containers, drink bottles and cans. Cool water can be used if it is temp sensitive, the point is to slick it up so the virus can't stick to it, &amp; wash it off.

3. Grab some gloves and discard unneeded outer packaging. (Note: if you have allergies, you might want to skip this one so you can keep stuff labeled):  Pop that pasta into a jar, the cereal can be stored in it's inner bags, etc.

Save the wipes for those items you need to use TODAY and hopefully every one who needs them can get more soon.

BONUS:  I'm doing a test to see if I can wash and reuse my Kirkland wipes in the washing machine for the future. I'll edit to let you know how they hold up.  The plan is to re-moisten them first with all that left over disinfectant that accumulates in the original package and then with Pinesol, hydrogen peroxide, or bleach water.

**You also don't need to clean your whole house or bathroom with these.**  Clean with regular products first and then hit just high touch areas like light switches and door knobs.  Good hand washing practices also help with reducing the virus on these surfaces.

Please stay safe out there and lets work together to ensure a good supply for everyone.",1,1594414990,texas,2020-07-10 15:03:10

CoronaVirusTX,jcollins1968,Fatality rate,"I am hearing a lot of people trying to down play things by looking at the total number of infections and then the deaths.  Baring the idea that the death rate is actually under-reported, isn't this a wrong way to look at it?  Wouldn't you want to take the pool of all people who have had the virus run it's course -- then the percentage that ended in death vs. recovery?  So, for example if I look at the state statistics in Texas there are 118,326 recovered and 2918 deaths.  The proper fatality is 2918/(118326+2918) = 2.4%. 

A lot of ""amature epidemiologists"" in my neighborhood are using the total cases, 210,585 and coming up with lower percentages because almost half the infected haven't finished with it.  Even worse, where I live in the suburbs of Dallas we haven't been hit with a lot of cases yet so the numbers aren't statistically valid.  So, in Frisco we have 546 total cases, 384 recoveries, and 3 deaths.  People are saying we have a 0.5% death rate when I think it should be 0.8%.  I've been too lazy to do a confidence interval calculation (imagine trying to explain that to people) but I believe that the fewer numbers of infections means we still haven't really gotten a statistically valid sample.  Of course there is also age demographics which could be skewing this as well.

CoronaVirusTX,OPengiun,Social Class Influencing Infection per Population. What are your thoughts?,"Recently [saw this article](https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/lewisville-flower-mound-highland-village/coronavirus/2020/07/10/tracking-covid-19-zip-code-75067-has-the-most-cases-in-lewisville-flower-mound-highland-village/), and it made me really think about the drastic differences of infections / population in such a small area.

After diving into the information a bit more, I believe the reason 75067 has the most reported cases / population is that they don't make as much money.

75077: 132 / 38,358 = 0.00344 ---- Median Household Income $111553

75067: 441 / 60,982 = 0.00723 ---- Median Household Income $69307

75057: 110 / 12,900 = 0.00852 ---- Median Household Income $56575

75028: 347 / 49,774 = 0.00697 ---- Median Household Income $119694

75022: 54 / 28,908 = 0.00186 ---- Median Household Income $148122

So let's plot these. [This graph easily demonstrates](https://i.imgur.com/ktgmkBo.png) that the communities with lower median income have a higher rate of infection. Do class differences really influence infection that much?

Can someone else confirm this or tell me why I'm wrong (if so)? It would be sickening to really know that money can be the only difference of 50% reduction in infections / population.",1,1594506059,texas,2020-07-11 16:20:59

[TXDSHS Covid hospitalizations](https://i.imgur.com/0ALzPhL.png) have followed a sigmoidal growth pattern over the past few days, contrary to the exponential growth in cases.

[Texas Tribune](https://i.imgur.com/LwbBhtr.png) dropped in total statewide hospitalizations for two days in a row late last week, and numbers have held steady since.

Although there was a sign on the door for people to wear a mask nobody was wearing a mask. To set the stage: full house, lots of loud chatter, employees all masked up, people drinking at the bar where I picked up my order. I doubled up—wearing a cloth mask with a surgical mask on top of the cloth mask. I looked up the sqft and it’s apparently 3,072 but that is for the whole restaurant. I was in there for approx 7 minutes. Since cases along with positivity rate(1k+ cases per day past 10 days), hospitalization rates increasing I’m worried that someone in that restaurant might have had covid and was spreading that shit around. Given me wearing a mask and short time period I was in there should I be worried? Hope the brisket flautas were worth it, honey.

CoronaVirusTX,lordsoloman,Please advise,"Don't know where else to put this, but, like 10 minutes ago I was at the gas station and some woman in a nurses outfit (not sure what that uniform is called, scrubs?), walks in making a big fuss. As stupid as her attitude was, I didn't care until I noticed the mask she was wearing was only covering her mouth - leaving her to spread germs all inside the store. So I called her out on it, expecting her to just put the fucking mask on as to not spread anything - and she responds with, ""I already had the coronavirus so I'm immune.""  


Now I'm fuming. Someone in the medical profession who has already been exposed to the virus has gone out of her way to raise the odds of others getting it. Is that a crime? Should she have a job as a nurse? I've very worried that I'm going to come down with it now - especially since I live with elderly relatives. If I come down with it, can I press charges?

With 2 days to go in the signup period, only 28.7% of students have opted in - individual schools vary from 8 to 52%.   In the parent survey at the end of the spring, 57% of parents said they wanted remote learning.

This is a very disappointing number as it is too many kids in the buildings to social distance correctly.  The question is do that many parents really feel safe or are they unaware they need to sign into the parent portal and opt in.

One problem may be that PISD sends out too much worthless communication (seriously maybe 5-10% of the messages they send me matter to my kids in any way at all).     They are the ""boy who cried wolf"" and a lot of parents may not be reading what they are sending out.",1,1594823525,texas,2020-07-15 08:32:05

CoronaVirusTX,dmkplcow,Texas Medical Center Updates - July 15,"[https://www.tmc.edu/coronavirus-updates/](https://www.tmc.edu/coronavirus-updates/)

Updates for today.

Capacity is continuing to show signs of leveling out (aka flattening the curve). This is probably due to a combination of factors. I suspect a few of the bigger reasons are:

1. they are at capacity and can't grow more, regardless of whether they think there is additional space. I've compared this to a bacterial sample reaching the edges of a petri dish.
2. Med Surge and ICU populations are balancing out. i.e. Med Surge is discharging faster than ICU is increasing. This could be because the younger population is starting to be discharged or moved into general population. And this could be good in that it will free up some staff for ICU.
3. Optimistically, this could mean that the predominance of new cases are more mild and don't require hospitalization Evidence of this is that new hospitalizations are generally flat (even though they fluctuate significantly day-to-day).

Lastly, just because the curve is flat, doesn't mean we are in the clear. Having a flat curve at this capacity means the staff is continuing to be overworked, less mild cases may not getting the treatment they need, and elective surgeries (many of which are very important) are still being postponed. Among other concerns.

Hope this helps. let me know if I made any mistakes and I'll fix.",5,1594831469,texas,2020-07-15 10:44:29

CoronaVirusTX,purgance,How are we going to handle the 'wells of infection' that Greg Abbott is creating with his patchwork policy?,"Greg Abbott has never met an effective policy he doesn't oppose.  

The obvious consequence of his 'many sizes fits none' Covid strategy is that areas that allow re-opening of schools are going to become deep wells of infected people.  

Meanwhile, areas that implement the recommended policy of social distancing until the caseload drops off will rapidly shed Covid cases.  

So we'll have areas that obey the medical advice and rapidly become 'uninfected' and areas that don't obey the medical advice and rapidly become saturated by the virus.  

As long as those two groups don't mingle, deaths will be confined to the areas with infections.  

But the problem emerges when people in the 'infected' zones need medical treatment they can only get in an 'uninfected' zone (or need food, equipment, work, family visits, etc they can only get in uninfected zones).  Now we have the potential for the 'infected' areas to continuously re-transmit the virus into areas from which the virus is being eradicated.  

What is the plan to address this situation?  I know that Greg Abbott does not have an answer to this question (which is why he should be impeached), but does anyone?

WTF are we going to do with tens of thousands of displaced citizens during a pandemic? Have our leaders come up with a plan? I would love to know because I hope they would be preparing but I doubt they are. How are we going to have our normal environment of helping our neighbors when the victims of a hurricane could be contagious?Food kitchens and shelters will be impossible to operate safely. Funding will be dried up due to bailing people out who were economically hurt by Covid. No other states will really be in a financial position to help. This is going to be tragic and there will be so many people that will suffer. I haven’t heard this issue being discussed anywhere but this would be horrible.",1,1594961530,texas,2020-07-16 22:52:10

[of respiratory viruses] https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009018&amp;type=printable,"This article called Mathematical Models of the effectiveness for reducing the spread \[of respiratory viruses\] is prime during COVID-19. In it is the most thorough and compelling discussing of how the percentage of face masks worn on both Infected individuals and Susceptible individuals affects the spread and speed of the pandemic: [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009018&amp;type=printable](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009018&amp;type=printable) If you only have time to read one scientific article this month---THIS should be the one!! Especially if you are hesitant about wearing masks and haven't yet begun promoting masks during this COVID-19 pandemic. Their data quality, scientific analysis of mathematical models, and all their calculations are excellent. Furthermore, their discussion is thorough with visuals that are clear and eye opening to the reality that we should be wearing masks as a first step--EARLY in the pandemic, not as a last resort. BUT even now with thousands of cases, masks are the only thing that can slow the spread. The profound effect of implementing masks, encouraging mask adherence, and especially masking those who are pre-symptomatic spreaders of the virus is fascinating. I really wish they also ran a module for if 100% of the population wore masks, but reality is, there will always be a few who are slow to accept the science behind wearing masks. 

The charts in this research paper are very clear and understandable. I highly recommend you read this if you love scientific research--or at least look at all their excellent visuals. This is by far the best analysis, and it can so easily be extrapolated to relate to COVID-19. We can see its implications playing out in real life during this pandemic in whether various countries, states/provinces, cities or regions have or haven't implemented universal mask ordinances. Not only that, but as this research paper illustrates, we can see monumental differences in outcomes depending at what point they implemented masks--whether at 10 infected, 100 infected, 1000 infected ,10,000 infected.... and how varying the percentage of the populations who complies with wearing masks either slows or speeds the spread of the pandemic. If by some miracle your city has fewer than 800 confirmed cases of COVID-19, don't fight the mask requirement by Governor Abbott. Instead actively embrace it, support it, encourage it, and educate others about it. The sooner masks are implemented in your city the greater the chance of avoiding mass casualties. But even if your city does have 800+ confirmed cases, don't be dismayed, instead pray all the harder that people will be encouraged and convicted to wear masks. Also with aerosol transmission very likely, social distancing and avoiding crowded indoor areas is key as well. Unite to send a positive message that there is indeed sound science and math that support masks as a vital strategy in controlling COVID-19.",1,1595025177,texas,2020-07-17 16:32:57

So, we saved up and we paid it off right as the shut down happened.

We cannot find a DMV that will schedule anything sooner than November. Not allowed to do it online. She needs to have a current license in order to renew her massage license to start her job. he doesn't have a passport or any other form of government photo ID.

CoronaVirusTX,triari,Something odd seems to be going on with the Tarrant County data or at least how it's presented.,"As a Tarrant County resident, Power BI lover, and data-fixated person I've been paying a lot of attention to the online county dashboard.

 [http://www.tarrantcounty.com/en/public-health/disease-control---prevention/coronaviruas.html](http://www.tarrantcounty.com/en/public-health/disease-control---prevention/coronaviruas.html) 

I started noticing what looked to be back-filling previous weeks' ""COVID-19 Cases by Report Date"" figures, but never really had the time to check.  I thought this might be a difference in the cutoff time for the ""New"" cases figure at the top of the page and the ""Cases by Report Date"" chart, maybe one of them is 12am-11:59PM and the other one is 3PM-2:59PM.  Something like that sounds totally normal and understandable

It kept bugging me so I grabbed a screenshot last Monday, July 13 and the total positive cases was 18483:

[Monday July 13 - 18483 cases](https://preview.redd.it/jx0quiqle3c51.png?width=1001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2cbf62f30c16de6c26134b44b542c2525b9b59b)

Today, July 20, I decided to look at what date on the ""Cumulative Cases and Deaths"" chart best corresponds to the total for July 13.  I was pretty surprised to find that the the day that was closest to 18483 total cases was July 10.  That's 3 days and I'm just having a hard time trying put together a scenario where this is all coherent (that doesn't mean there isn't one).

&amp;#x200B;

[July 20 chart showing 18487 total cases on July 10th](https://preview.redd.it/8t41kcpsf3c51.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b1f76db8a099e605b8649a45422733cce32bfc7)

This way of presenting the data will always make it ***look*** like the curve is flattening which could give some folks a false sense of security even if the intention was completely benign.

I wouldn't be surprised if a giant backlog of cases gets dropped like down in Bexar, but we'll see.  

The cool evil thing to do would be to keep back-filling the cases until new cases actually ***do*** start to go down, then you never have to drop a big backlog (or when you do no one cares, because the crisis is over), but I don't want to get too tinfoil hat here.",98,1595287000,texas,2020-07-20 17:16:40

**TL;DR Thought I had Covid, got negative results, I just want people to take proper precautions and not be selfish.**

I’m recovering (mentally and physically) from a bad cold that I thought was Covid at first. Luckily I got a test pretty quickly and it came back negative, (I live in south Texas) but I can’t stop thinking about how scared I was. I’m currently living with my parents (both of whom are in a higher risk group) and I was just terrified that if I had it, it could get passed on to them. 

I realize I’m mostly preaching to the choir here, but I beg you: PLEASE WEAR MASKS AND DON’T PARTY RIGHT NOW. I do not want anyone else to get sick and have to go through the fear and stress I did. And to the selfish bastards who think they’re invincible and/or think this is a hoax and keep whining “bUt MUh freEDom”: suck it the fuck up.

my mom signed me up for in-person school, and we were under the impression that sports and band rehearsals would be canceled entirely. we got an email yesterday saying that anyone that signed up for in-person school MUST do marching and go to all the rehearsals. I am not comfortable doing in person marching band. I feel that no matter what we will not be able to completely social distance because of the number of students we have. I don't know how I can get out of it. I don't feel comfortable going to in-person band because I've seen all the Snapchat stories of my friends running around town without masks on. it seems like my hands are tied and I must go to in-person band so I get a good grade. assuming 50% or more of the students in marching band will attend that is still 400+ people. i'm very worried.

any advice? or do you guys think all in-person school practices will be canceled?",25,1595529997,texas,2020-07-23 12:46:37

For me (Dallas county), I started WFH in March... my company just barely started bringing in more core essential employees into work end of May, and then a sudden uptick occurred and now we’re back again to WFH across the board.

This entire summer could probably continue to trend up or flatten relatively high, and fall/winter is around the corner, which probably won’t help with the spread of cases.

My guess is that generally if permissible, people will be WFH through at least June 2021. What are your opinions?",1,1595712596,texas,2020-07-25 15:29:56

CoronaVirusTX,swayz38,Fury of Covid in small communities.,"Ok on mobile. But I have a story to share. 

Today I went with my mom to look at tiny homes for me. I’m ready to be done being in apartments around people. Done

Ok so this is the first time since January that we’ve seen each other. She’s a mask wearer but not religiously, but she wore her mask for me to feel safe and I wore my double masks and face shield. 

Anywho, our tiny home tour went great because we were allowed to Perdue the homes on our own and report back at social distance with the home seller. 

Alright so in our drive back from the home seller to my moms house we got to talking about coronavirus. I don’t know anyone personally that got it, they live way out in the country. Out in the sticks. Like their tiny town had one stop sign kind of shit. Well, they have had one family of three (dad mom adult daughter) who all got it, and they live in the next town over which is even smaller, dad got severely ill but not hospitalized, mom just didn’t feel well and daughter was a symptomatic, then they know a single mom of three who had to regular testing for her job, positive, no symptoms. Then finally a long time family friend who non stop talked about the virus being a cold, blah blah blah, you know, well she ended up with it in the hospital on a vent and came close to taking the room temp challenge a few times. She is now in rehab because she can’t walk. She can’t walk. Ffs. 

Can y’all wear masks please. Jesus Christ. This out in nowhere Texas.",1,1595721066,texas,2020-07-25 17:51:06

So I thought at first. Eh baby cough prob allergies.  

Actually went to the dr and they didn’t. Test because it was cough only and gave me a z pack


Cough stayed.  

Had a night of feeling nauseous. Threw up

Had another night feeling bad. Almost threw up


Cough still happening at night time when laying down especially 

One day get my shoes one. Stand up.  Feel extremely dizzy

Get tested finally about 12 days ago. 

Negative


I think I took it too late


Get random nerve sensory hallucinations I believe

Sometimes in my mid back I would get a feel of something moving or like a bubble. Or the nerve being poked maybe

After that I’d get a rush of almost like adrenaline to my face

Temporarily zone out.  Maybe a brain zap?

Past 4 days.  Weird nerve rush tingle feels. In random places random times

Stiff neck


I believe I’m a long hauler. And seeking any education on how to help get rid of it quicker and maybe lessen my symptoms.  Thanks for any help.",1,1595754579,texas,2020-07-26 03:09:39

After lurking here for quite some time and, honestly, using this subreddit to help make decisions on the ground regarding how I take care of my patients and lead my team I wanted to contribute and try to be part of the solution. I put together a short essay meant for nonmedical/ non scientific readers mapping out the most pertinent statistics in as straight forward a manner. 

It is part of a 2, perhaps 3 part series I am putting together on the subject. 

Part 1 is in regards to the idea of absolute vs relative risk in regards to covid and mortality data in general. I then acknowledge the limitations of current data and the specific challenge of applying the known data to the American population specifically given known health data. 

Part 2 goes on to talk about the relative risk reductions on masks, social distancing, and what the hell an R0 is and why it matters for strategic planning. I admit I make an appeal to good will at the end. Big data aside I have seen too much death and suffering these part four months. My patients need our help. 

I do not have a part 3 yet however it has been requested that I map out the economic damages given some of the possible decisions that may come in the next few weeks. I admit that is out of my wheelhouse. If someone with a more robust economic background wants to help me then I would sincerely appreciate it. 

I hope what I wrote has utility. I know that in the subreddit I am preaching to the choir but I'm hoping the way I frame the data will help y'all communicate what is at stake.

I had symptoms pretty bad when I took it, they went away 3 or 4 days after I took my test so I was pretty sure I didn't have it, but you never know. I still isolated. Had minimal contact with my fiancee (man that sucked) for 14 days, now it's been so long and we've had to do so much stuff together it's kind of impossible to stay totally away so we don't do it as much, she also hasn't gotten sick at all this whole time (fingers crossed). 6 days after my test I started showing symptoms *again* and they haven't gone away. Well, since my result came back negative it's back off to work. sigh. I'm really hoping I don't get anyone sick or have it now. The lag time in testing is more problematic than I thought. Seeing first hand how it can negatively effect the purpose of the test has made me more worried about testing. Sure we may do a lot, but what's the point when it takes a lot of places 10-14 days? Mind. Blown.

CoronaVirusTX,Jelfff,(1) Interactive COVID-19 map showing recent trends per county and (2) downloadable csv files with case and death counts per day for each county starting March 24,"As a public service I produce an interactive map that uses COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University to tell at a glance whether the number of new cases or deaths in each county is trending up or trending down.  The information for the map is updated each night.

The symbols on the map summarize the recent trends as follows:

* Circle		Prior 14 days
* Triangle	        Prior 7 days
* Green		Good - numbers are trending down
* Red		Bad - numbers are trending up

Click any symbol for the prior 14 day counts for that country.  (A few symbols on the map represent cities.)

Open the map and show data about new cases:

The map has a number of overlays that you can turn on/off.  You can display data about recent cases or recent deaths.  The data can be displayed by county, by state or by country.

If you need help using the map, please read the **“Map tips”** (link in upper left corner).

The data that Johns Hopkins is curating is a cumulative count of cases and deaths for all counties in the USA.  You can find that data on their GitHub page at:

[https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

I wrote code that **converts the Johns Hopkins timeseries \*cumulative\* counts into \*daily\* counts of cases and deaths for all counties**.  These daily counts begin March 24th and are in csv files that anyone can download and import into GIS or spreadsheet software.  I made a PDF with details about (1) the interactive map and (2) these csv files.

I've known that he and her were getting tested for Corona virus. This morning, I happened to wake up very early, and I got a text from him saying they both came up positive for Corona virus.

I'm trying to think through all of this, as in whether I should be worried and what to do next.

I messaged a friend on Facebook, and she gave her two cents:

""If you're cautious or worried no harm taking safety measures like maybe you'll have to use a disinfectant spray and wipes inside your car. If you want to get tested might be too soon. Even if you had a mask on maybe quarantine yourself for 14days. Not sure how possible that is with your work. Maybe mention you were exposed coz just coz you don't have symptoms you can still pass it. Do your laundry. I suggest fruits, liquids, Emergen-C packets for a few days. Those would be my suggestion or probably what I would do if it was me. Up to you to decide how you want to handle it.""",1,1596025224,texas,2020-07-29 06:20:24
CoronaVirusTX,adidasnmotion,My predictions on how the pandemic will progress over the next few months here in Texas (and probably the rest of the country). Thoughts?,"So lately I’ve been thinking about how all of this is going to progress over time. This is what I see happening here in Texas

-	Cases will continue to slowly go down over the next 1-3 months, more a gentle sloping plateau than a steep drop-off
-	As these numbers improve, the current pressure to re-open bars/increase business occupancy will grow more and more.  Not only will this come from businesses and local politicians/leaders in the state but from the president as well
-	These same groups will also increase pressure on relaxing the face mask mandate as the numbers slowly get better
-	eventually that pressure becomes too much and the governor starts to cave
-	At the same time there is enough pressure to make schools resume in person classes after this initial online-only period that ends at the end of September.
-	As these rules relax, people in the state also stop being as careful because we again get a false sense of security thinking the worst is behind us
-	The slow drop in cases levels off then slowly starts going back up
-	At first there is denial that we’re heading the wrong way and people in the state continue relaxing our habits and politicians continue relaxing safety measures.
-	Once its way past obvious that we have a problem again leaders start trying to slowly impose restrictions again, all the while getting pushback from businesses, local leaders, and other politicians which slows down the imposition of safety measures
-	Finally we end up back where we are today

I guess I could have just written that I think what happened before will happen again in the same way it did before except with the added complication of it possibly being worse or progressing faster because it happens during our regular flu season.

People need to stop thinking that this is all about them and that they are invincible. in some way because this could happen to everyone. I can guarantee if people continue to act the way they do the States are gonna shut everything down and it will be a lot longer then a month

CoronaVirusTX,happysnappah,"Thinking about withdrawing my kids for this year - letting them take a ""gap"" year. Question on legality","My kids are 16 and 17, the 17-year-olds will be 18 in September. They're going to be a junior and seniors this year. TEA has me concerned because while we were happy going with a remote learning platform because our school does that pretty well, TEA has shown that they are not keeping the interests of our kids or teachers in mind. IN addition, there are so many people in our community that are brainwashed with the ""it's a hoax, the numbers are made up, masks are a muzzle,"" etc mindset that I feel it will take a statewide shutdown to control the spread here. 

That said, I don't think there's much harm in keeping them home this year and letting them do some self-directed learning or possibly even getting jobs that will help people like learning how to do contract tracing, working remotely for TWC, etc. 

The only thing I wonder about is the junior, if I will be allowed to withdraw her without replacing her enrollment with a homeschool program. My desire is NOT to homeschool but rather to just skip this year and have them return to school in 2021-2022 when it's (hopefully) safer. Can I do that?",1,1596047578,texas,2020-07-29 12:32:58

CoronaVirusTX,The_Higher_Reverend,The real reason behind the arguments regarding school opening is...JEALOUSY,"Should we open schools or strictly do online learning? In reality there should not be a discussion. But there is. Because our society and government in Texas decided to open up all other businesses when the safest option was not to reopen. 

If parents were not being forced to go back to their jobs in-person, and working from home was an option for everyone that can; the school opening discussion would be moot. Yes, some jobs can not feasible work from home and in those positions we as a society should do everything to prevent and mitigate the spread of the virus in those arenas. A majority of jobs and school included is not something that HAS to be in-person. If it did, then there would not be a need for an argument or discussion. But there obviously is a discussion so therefore the option for online learning is feasible. And IF we can save lives or simply save something from getting severely ill by offering that option then we MUST make that decision. 

If you are mad about schools not reopening for in-person instruction because you are back to in-person work and believe everyone else should be, then maybe you should access why your company put your life at risk for their gain.",1,1596127049,texas,2020-07-30 10:37:29

CoronaVirusTX,swayz38,Getting a little worried. Some symptoms presenting.,"Alright so I’m on mobile so yeah here’s the deal 

I worked from home from the second week of March until six weeks ago. People at my work threw tantrums that I was work from home even though some others could and chose not to. No one wears masks, virus is just a cold people, right?

Ok so i go back to the office, double mask and face shield. I don’t go anywhere else. I did go look at tiny home last Saturday, but that when my symptoms started so it’s doubtful that I started having symptoms only four hours after viewing tiny homes alone with my mom, the sales guy did not come with us and when we did speak to him we all had masks and distanced. 

Ok so diarrhea and weird gagging with a bit of vomit (mornings only for the gag vomit thing and only after eating for the diarrhea). I chalked it up to maybe my cooking or the fact that I’ve been drinking too much and I’m on quite a few meds right now along with dehydration from not drinking fluids for ten hours a day 

I work in an office where no one wears masks, no social distancing, parties, visitors almost every day, everyone going to restaurants for lunch, several people with really bad coughs working and people with “fevers” working (the logs have been left out in the open from the temp checks and I’ve seen them). 

So today leaving work I happened to be pulling out of the parking lot behind my boss, he literally stopped his truck, opened the door and vomited on the ground. WTF. So then I get home and do my decon routine and now my throat feels like it is on fire. I cannot sleep. I’m just sick with worry. I’ve been so cautious. 

If I got this shit from work with people who don’t give a shut imma be pissed. I’m very high risk for severe complications.",1,1596178832,texas,2020-07-31 01:00:32

I'm a member of an organization that is supposed to be vending and presenting at a conference on August 22nd in Arlington, which was booked in January. I came on board to help with the presentation in May, thinking it's possible that the event would be viable by August. Well, that's clearly not the case!

The event center is closed, with no opening date in sight. However, the event organizers are still posting online as if the conference is on. 

I'm reaching out to the head organizer with a link to the City of Arlington post stating that their event centers are closed, but I'd also like to include any state or Tarrant County ordinances that specifically prevent large indoor gatherings. I've found references to 50% capacity in restaurants, but nothing that specifically refers to conferences or indoor events. 

Help equip me to have this conversation with the correct resources on my side!

Thanks!

And when you look at the amount of recoveries that are happening now, it is absolutely bonkers. There is a big difference in the data before and after the White House HHS took over the data handling from the CDC. 

If you look at recoveries, they were following a rather noticeable trend and ended at ~8000 with around 150 people recovering a day. The next few days, right after the White House took control, the recoveries jumped to 22000 and are now at close to 34000, around 1000 people a day are recovering!

CoronaVirusTX,sh17s7o7m,Did I over react after my mom lied and put me at risk?,"Long story. TLDR at the bottom. My mother lives with me, in a city that is a raging COVID19 hot spot right now. I am high risk, as is my disabled son.  I pay for all the bills bc my mom was in a bad car accident and can't work, so she doesn't contribute at all. My mother acknowledges the pandemic is bad, but somehow justifies continuing to do risky activities. It was really bad in the beginning, but she had gotten better about respecting my wishes until today.

Yesterday she told me my sister was getting married today and she wanted to go. She swore up and down that it was outside and they would be wearing masks, so I reluctantly agreed despite the fact that there would be multiple families there and my sister's best friend who is a HEALTHCARE WORKER in Florida of all fucking places. The way I understood it, she would go to the wedding and come home.

She basically snuck out of the house while I was taking a nap, which was weird but whatever. Then around 9pm I text her bc there was a pretty bad thunderstorm to make sure she was ok and when she would be home. She then told me that she was staying the night. In the same house with the BF from Florida. And I know for a fact they weren't outside bc of the storm and probably didn't wear masks bc they knew they could get away with it.

Y'all, I saw red. I basically yelled at her through text, and she tried to lay on the guilt bc she misses my niece, and I wouldn't want her to abandon my son for months, but she literally did that and screwed me over by moving in with my sister for 8 months bc she couldn't handle a baby alone. She accused me of going for ""low blows"" (the truth isn't a low blow, she just can't handle being called out) and said she was done talking. I told her she needed to figure out what her priorities are and left it at that.

I tried going to sleep but I am so angry bc I feel like she is being really selfish and doesn't care if I catch the virus and die. I'm the only parent my son has and it would devastate him. So I sent her this text, basically laying down the law and telling her she's not allowed to go anywhere anymore. If this doesn't work I am seriously considering telling her to find someplace else to live.

""1) you need to wear a mask for the next week in the house

2) if you start showing symptoms you're packing a bag and staying with sister. I'm high risk and I'm not going to die bc you're selfish

3) No more going out. 

Sister isn't high risk so I'm sure she is doing whatever considering she flew in a healthcare worker from a worse hotspot than here, but family gatherings are the #1 spread and my life isn't worth your BS. I tried treating you like an equal bc you're an adult, but obviously you don't give a fuck that i could literally die so no more. My house my rules. Not up for discussion. ""

TLDR: I'm high risk, mom lied to me and is doing stuff that could kill me so I grounded her

One week later

All data is handed to HHS directly causing a fluctuation in the numbers, strangely for republican states

“The chy-nun virus is lowering and most states are doing terrific. Just great. I’ve done so much to help this pandemic... so much...”

Death toll rises and trust in government lowers due to polls (sketchy info but still)

“A vaccine will be here by the end of the year, maybe January” -Trump

“We are cautiously optimistic about the vaccine but the trials are going well”- Fauci 

I believe the last week or so (since HHS got it) the numbers have been off and wrong.

They really rationalized each symptom as follows:
-fever (probably the mold that's high)
-headache (same)
-heartburn (sometimes it happens)
-cold sweats (maybe menopause)
-lung sounds (well they said it was bronchitis but I don't have a cough so maybe they heard my stomach making sounds"")

I am so aggravated about this, I live in Payson and it’s a hotspot. Myself, husband, and baby have been in lockdown since March. We only go out to get groceries. We don’t even see our families. 

What gets me so upset about this is that the Payson City Council officials won’t state what employeer made their sick employee come into work who then proceeded to spread a potentially deadly virus to other workers. 

THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!!!

We need to do our part and make this information publicly available and they need to take responsibility for their actions. 

I have no idea how to go about doing this.

Is anyone else as fired up about this as I am that knows how we could figure out what business was so irresponsible. I am so upset that the Payson City Council is trying to protect them. This needs to come out.

I don't mean to discredit your opinion In any way, but i can vape through my mask. A friend of mine argued with me on FB and said that cough and sneeze particles are larger than my vapor. I AGREED with him vehemently, and argued that as I am not coughing or sneezing, merely breathing, my breath's particulate is smaller than my vape... 

I haven't visited my mother in months, usually every Sunday, she is older and has an underlying breathing condition. I don't want her to get it (or anything else), because it could kill her. 

My issue is that we listen to media/health organizations that flopped back and forth on the mask issue for months. The WHO, that America boycotts, says it's only medical professionals that need to wear them. The CDC has classified cases and deaths under ""PIC"" (pneumonia, influenza, corona (corona is also the family of the common cold)) which i see as the same as saying suicides from jumping from high places is the same as skydiver deaths from faulty parachutes. I respect your safety and always hope you're safe. I don't mean to disrespect anyone by going into the gas station sans mask. Never before have we quarantined the healthy. 

If this doesn't end immediately after the election i will eat my words. I do not discredit that the virus is real and can kill. I only discredit that it is not a tool being used by many facets of political and corporate entities for gain. I keep trying to find overall deaths per year or month 2019 vs. 2020 and the only info is from 2017? Can't we just cough into our shirts like civilized people? It's thicker than my mask.

CoronavirusUT,jaysedai,Shingles and a request,"Just an interesting FYI and a request for help at the bottom.

Our family has been super careful about self quarantining since basically early March. And we've been on strict regimens of supplements that should minimize the impact should we catch it. About 3 weeks ago we all felt just a bit under the weather, super minor symptoms, not terribly COVID-like either, and   
 the symptoms passed in a couple of days (though not all at the same time). I was fairly certain it was not COVID. 

But, then just over a week ago I got shingles. The 'doc on the phone' said they've seen a huge uptick in shingles in Utah. Upon further research, it turns out many of the ""long haulers"" are actually struggling with previous viral infections (often mono) that took advantage of the immune suppression of the SARS-COV2 virus. Backstory: some viruses we catch are never fully killed off, that includes the chickenpox/shingles virus, and the virus that causes mono. Basically these viruses hide away for life because the t-cells of our immune system knows how to fight off any attempt for them to ""come out"". But COVID is very effective at suppressing our t-cells as an early part of its infection process. And these older latent viruses take full advantage and come out.

So I'm now inclined to think our family all caught COVID, but were lucky enough to have very mild cases (supplements probably helped!). It's now too late to check for active infections, but I'd love to get an antibody test. Does anyone know where I can get a local antibody test?",1,1595712174,utah,2020-07-25 15:22:54

CoronavirusUT,TheCerberus14,Fishy COVID numbers (why the sudden daily drop),"So I've been curious about why Utah's daily COVID numbers have been much lower in recent days but no broad, large scale policy change appears to have been implemented that would have caused this affect. My suspicion was it may have been related to the order from the White House to redirect reporting number to the HHS and this always left me wondering if that could be related and how that could be shown if true. 

This chart of the daily cases in red vs blue states appears to show that the day the hand off for the data from the CDC to the HHS has a direct correlation to the lower numbers reported per day in red states (ie. Utah).  This is very concerning for the safety of anyone who has a condition that may make them more susceptible to the virus, like myself. I will be continuing to operate as though the numbers are still going up and we're not getting the full picture we need to properly protect ourselves.

That's nice, but asking people to self-identify is ridiculous. COVID is also spread by people who feel well but are asymptomatic, and we are doing absolutely nothing to find out who they are. 

Other countries who have successfully controlled the spread - not eradicated it, just controlled it to the point where they can function somewhat normally - are doing serious contact tracing. Here is how serious contact tracing works: 

When a positive case is identified, everyone who has had direct contact (not just family, but everyone the infected person can recall) is contacted and isolated. This means true isolation, like in a repurposed hotel. It is not voluntary. They are tested. If the test is negative they are released. If positive, the direct contacts of that person are contacted and isolated. This is how you find cases that are asymptomatic and cut off the chain of transmission. People won't like it - my civil liberties, gah!

On the other hand, we have plenty of empty hotels.

No-one has the liberty to walk around and place time bombs everywhere they go. This is effectively what is happening.

Also, does the Department of Health know something about COVID that nobody else in the world knows? I'm talking about the graph that shows the people who have ""recovered"" from the illness. Really? All of those people have gotten antibody testing? (And if so, because I really don't know the answer to how the DOH is reaching that conclusion, what about the studies showing that antibodies fade?) This looks to me like a politically motivated graph - anything to make the statistics look a bit less alarming.

I always thought the State of Utah's COVID page was good for a laugh when it used to say ""Stay Strong Utah - It's working"" Yes, the virus spread was and is working very well. I notice they've eliminated the ""It's working"" part.",1,1596655786,utah,2020-08-05 13:29:46

coronavirusVA,blurryfacedfugue,4th of July Worries,"Hey everyone, hope this is finding you in good health.  I also hope everyone had a good 4th.  I needed to get this off my chest.  I really don't think we're going to pull out of this virus on our own efforts, if it goes away I feel like it will be much more due to luck.

So I was hanging out with my brother for the 4th, and I bought my kids over.  My kids haven't been out of the house since this started, other than for one doctor appointment and playing in the backyard.  As the night wore on neighbors started coming over with their kids.  No one was wearing face masks.  These are all middle class college educated folks, with good jobs, nice houses, and responsible for kids.  I'm so totally stunned at that night.  I protested to my brother but I couldn't put up a huge ruckus.  Why don't more people know that masks protect other people?  I am just...just..

Like, if I used an analogy no one would have a problem.  I don't think any of those parents would let me drive their kids around, even just in the culdesac, without seatbelts or carseats.  I'm a safe driver, and belts don't protect you 100%, but we want the people we love to wear them in case \*something\* does happen.  Sure, if nothing happens, fine, but if it does, it could be really bad.  Am I the crazy one here?",1,1594075867,virginia,2020-07-06 16:51:07

They think a lot more people will be refusing to wear masks and we cannot them they need to. After saying I wasn’t comfortable with that I was then told that masks “are not a requirement in VA going into phase 3- they are only highly recommended and I needed to take the sign down on the front door that I made saying “masks are required”.  That he sees people in Walmart, Target, and the grocery store all without masks and that these stores only have a “highly suggested mask” sign on their doors- I know this isn’t true as I was there on Sunday and the sign deff. Says required per VA state law.
I disagreed with him and said no, In VA it is a mandate since the end of May and there is no end date as far as I can see. He asked me to show him the article.
My doctor said he’ll have to think about it, but he’s pretty sure as long as your 6 feet apart you don’t need a mask.
I said it wasn’t either/or- it was mask AND 6 feet apart.
He goes “I didn’t get into this business being a germaphobe- we were masks and continue doing what we’ve always done and it’s fine”.

I’m pretty sure it is, but to be safe is the mask mandate is still going on?",1,1594202365,virginia,2020-07-08 03:59:25

NOTE: VDH delays posting the data downloads by almost 2 hours after making the data available on the VDH COVID 19 dashboard.  Now that I rely on the data downloads I'm unable to produce metrics until this data is made available.

We are researchers from Rowan University seeking to understand the mental health impact of COVID-19 and how individuals are struggling to cope during the pandemic. **Right now, our study is underrepresented from Virginia so we are seeking out participants from that part of the country.** Anyone who is at least 18 years old, English speaking, and a resident of the United States is welcome to take part. This comprehensive survey is anticipated to take between 20 and 40 minutes to complete and **participants will be entered into a drawing for a chance to win a $100 Visa card. One out of every 25 participants will be randomly selected to win.** Participants will also have the option to be considered to participate in follow-up research that will result in further compensation.

* Virginia reported 844 new cases across the state.

Note on the number of daily tests chart. Bottom line is the daily testing numbers are different.   I updated this yesterday to reflect the VDH testing datasheet which I download instead of the manual method.  The manual method was simply subtracting yesterday's total tests from today's total tests.  Either way, I think I've migrated away from manually entering the data into a spreadsheet and now it's all imported.  I never would have started tracking cases if VDH had simply published the number of new cases on their website like other states do such as [Florida](https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/).

coronavirusVA,Pilot-B,Producing Virginia COVID Stats,"Several of you have offered to help produce stats - THANK YOU! 

I have attempted to write up some basic instructions in the excel file I use.

Disclaimer.  I'm not a professional developer.  I'm just a regular person interested in this kind of stuff.  I'm not a wizard at excel and have learned a TON since I started doing this.  Pivot tables are my weakest, and I've already learned that I probably over engineered this thing when a few clicks of the pivot table would have worked.  

* The biggest thing is you simply need to download and import the raw VDH data to make it all work.  
* New Cases Data
* Testing Data
* Pay special attention to presorting the downloaded data before importing - you'll save yourself 5-10 minutes of spinning wheel.  I told you so.
* Refresh each pivot table then update the pivot table filter to account for the added date (most recent date - usually today).  
* Those who are excel wizards will quickly figure out what I've done and find quick ways to simplify things.  NOTE: I'm not using the most recent version of excel and I'm also using the MAC OS version.  The windows version has some cool new ways to sort and filter things that I know will take even more manual steps out of the little process.
* I don't have a ton of time to help explain the various nuances, but will try when able. 

Remember, I'm just a novice.

Apply for a free, home-based, self-collected COVID-19 test at [https://scanpublichealth.org/](https://scanpublichealth.org/).

TLDR? The FDA continues to frustrate the efforts of the SCAN to offer testing.

Update:

&gt;... the greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) resumed operations as a research study on June 10th, continuing the program’s COVID-19 testing for home-based, self-collected samples. In that update we also notified you that, due to current FDA policy, SCAN is unable to return results for samples submitted prior to the program’s pause on May 12th.   
&gt;  
&gt;Over the past two weeks, we have continued to investigate all potential options to get these results to you. Regrettably, we were unable to obtain authorization to do so. SCAN will therefore securely destroy all affected samples. Data and personal information from these samples have not been and will not be analyzed, shared, or retained. 

This does not mean that you cannot receive test kit. Apply for a free, home-based, self-collected COVID-19 test at [https://scanpublichealth.org/](https://scanpublichealth.org/).

This update indicates that the FDA continues to frustrate the efforts of the SCAN to offer testing.

March 1: SCAN is in discussion with FDA.

March 23: SCAN initiates process to authorize their lab-developed test and self-swab kit.

April 13: SCAN submits data in accordance with the EUA process and timeline to secure federal authorization.

(uncertain date) SCAN’s test is authorized by the Washington State Department of Health.

April 21: "" FDA [re-issued the emergency use authorization](https://www.fda.gov/media/136148/download) (EUA) for the Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) COVID-19 RT-PCR Test to permit testing of samples self-collected by patients at home using LabCorp’s Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 Test home collection kit."" "" LabCorp intends to make the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 Test home collection kits available to consumers in most states, with a doctor’s order, in the coming weeks."" [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-test-patient-home-sample-collection](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-test-patient-home-sample-collection) 

May 12: SCAN is paused when the FDA issues new guidance for home-based, self-collected samples to test for COVID-19.

(uncertain date) SCAN submits data in accordance with the revised FDA process.

Jun 10: SCAN is re-launched as a research study with an institutional review board (IRB).

To date, the FDA has not approved either EUA for SCAN.  ""The FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN’s test."" SCAN proceeds without the FDA. I inserted the LabCorp event in the timeline to indicate that the FDA can make a decision. I have no reason to suspect that LabCorp has a sweetheart relationship with the FDA. For any other FDA contact LabCorp seems to have preceded SCAN by a week.

""SCAN is a partnership between the team behind the Seattle Flu Study and Public Health — Seattle &amp; King County. It is executed by the Brotman Baty Institute, a collaboration between UW Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Seattle Children’s. SCAN relies on data modeling support from the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM).

The seven new deaths is lower than the 12 yesterday.

with cases continuing to stay in the 500 range for weeks now it is hard for me to see how the deaths won't eventually rise. It can take up to a month for a new case to progress to fatality (and longer sometimes). I realize that many of the new infections are coming from younger populations, but even younger people do sometimes die from this. Worse, the more young people who get it the harder it is to isolate the vulnerable and we will eventually see it manifest in the elderly again.

If only everyone would wear masks.

I was surprised to not find any graphs directly comparing covid data with the flu, but based off of DOH WA we have had 104 confirmed flu deaths during the 2019 - 2020 flu season. Compaired with our 1339 Covid deaths, about 12 times as much. It stated the last 8 previous years having: 240, 283, 274, 64, 147, 76, 54, and 15 flu deaths. 

What other stats have any of you found to be relavent? Does anyone have IFR numbers for flu cases vs covid? (what's the consensus for covid IFR around 1 or 2 percent?)

Anyway, just trying to get some realistic comparison between covid and the flu. I can't just say it's 12 times as deadly as the flu if I don't know how many people were in fected with the flu right? How much (or less) deadly is Covid than seasonal flu?",1,1593666490,washington,2020-07-01 23:08:10

CoronavirusWA,Zodep,Thoughtful Thursday,"**Compliment people wearing masks**

I go out of my way to compliment people wearing masks.

Right now there is a battle for people to wear masks. Let’s keep it positive and let people know we appreciate the masks they’re wearing.

Try to keep the comment realistic to who you are. I saw a lady with a puppy mask and let her know I like it. I saw a guy with a Seahawks mask and let him know I’m a fan too.

The more we help people feel comfortable about wearing masks, the better things will get.

Yelling and forcing people won’t work. We need a positive image about masks. Encourage your fellow men and women.

Keep it up guys! We’ll get this under control again. One compliment at a time.

 What that means is beginning Tuesdays, businesses will not be allowed to legally serve customers goods or services unless their patrons are adhering to this requirement and are wearing face coverings",1,1593728233,washington,2020-07-02 16:17:13
CoronavirusWA,tenthousandthousand,"Summary of Inslee's July 2 press conference - modified phase 1 for Benton/Franklin/Yakima, statewide 2-week pause in advancing phases, new mask mandate","* Inslee is wearing a mask throughout the whole presentation. 
* **New statewide requirement: businesses cannot serve customers who are not wearing masks.** This is a legal requirement, not a suggestion.
* Hopefully this will mean that we do not need to go through another shutdown.
* If you have a medical condition, you do not have to disclose the specifics to businesses. Simply say that you have a medical condition and the business will honor it.
* Cases are increasing statewide. Now basically at the same level it was at during the worst of April. Not limited to just one part of the state - King, Spokane, Whatcom, Pierce, Franklin all showing increases. Yakima has seen cases decrease. Only wearing masks can stop this without closing the state back down.
* Proportion of positive tests has increased over the past couple of weeks. 
* Hospital admission has increased from 20/day in early June to 28/day in late June. Very concerning since this lags behind infections by about two weeks.
* R0 (as of mid-June) is still slightly above 1 in eastern Washington and higher than that (about 1.5) in western Washington. This is not solely because of more testing. It is because people are interacting more with each other. Masks are the only way to interact safely with each other.
* **No counties will be advancing to any new phase until July 16 at minimum.** This includes counties that have sent in applications before this point. 
* Inslee reiterates a great deal of prior information about how masks work and keep others safe, best practices for the holiday weekend, stay with your ""immediate household and a very small close circle of friends if you must."" Republicans such as Mike Pence, Mitch McConnell, Dan Newhouse, all agree about this, good that we are all unified on this policy.
* 3.6 million masks are being delivered to low-income people throughout the state.
* Benton/Franklin/Yakima residents have been going to other counties for non-essential services, which is a concern. **Preparations are being made to move Benton/Franklin/Yakima to a modified phase one, allowing construction, manufacturing, limited outdoor dining and in-store retail, pet grooming, gatherings smaller than five.** This will help those counties' businesses and stop infections from crossing county lines. Mask usage will still be completely mandatory. Plans for phase 1.5 in these counties are being developed in conjunction with local health departments and county commissioners, they will determine the exact timeline for implementation of it (likely within the next couple of days). Mask usage in some places in Benton/Franklin is up to 90%, increased significantly in Yakima as well.
* There is some very preliminary evidence (not yet conclusive) that increase in mask usage has reduced the rate of infection in Yakima County.
* **Bar and counter service is no longer allowed under phase 3.** Goal is to eliminate ""prolonged mingling."" Patrons will need to sit down at tables.
* We hope to ""avoid the fate"" of closing down restaurants as other states have had to do.
* More than 15 lawsuits have been brought over the past several months against Inslee's orders, none have been granted. 
* Questions from press:
* Did some counties move too quickly to phase 3? The decisions we have made have been appropriate and based on science. Inslee does not regret any of them, we have been as successful as any other location. Increased virus activity reflects increased activity in the population and not being as careful as we should. Next two weeks will allow us to see what's going on with the numbers and give time to observe effect of recent mask mandates. Other states have seen positive effects within five days of their own mandates. 
* Mask mandate includes working out in gyms? Gyms only open in phase 3 at 50% capacity. Masks required if you cannot keep physical distance within that space.
* Need for a special session at this time? Our budget will be able to last until January. Special session will not be ruled out, but we have the financial capability to last until then.
* Where are the increase in cases coming from? People are increasing their interactions, not respecting physical distancing, expanding their circle of close contacts too large. People are exhausted, but we are in this for the long haul. These additional measures will bring us to success.
* Compliance and enforcement of the new mask mandate? We have had massive compliance with all current and past mandates. There will be sanctions available (fines, potential closure, LNI violation sanctions) but we do not want to use those systems.
* What about the compliant businesses who are worried that non-compliant businesses will force a larger closure? Can aspects of due process be suspended to encourage quick action for non-compliance? Inslee believes that will not happen. Enforcement is possible if people do not comply. 
* How will the state get testing materials to counties with shortages? We have asked the federal government to provide more effective kits. Also working to increase contact tracing and isolation compliance, improve support system for families that need to isolate. Businesses will need to comply with broad-scale testing if ordered.
* Masking survey requirement? Only in Benton/Franklin/Yakima so far. Some wider examinations in grocery store chains. This is an ""iterative process,"" the survey may be expanded to future counties if necessary. 
* Difficulty in businesses cooperating with investigation and contact tracing? Largely successful, some businesses did not respond immediately to their local health departments, that has improved recently. 
* Response to upcoming ""freedom protests"" in Benton/Franklin? Vast majority of people are wearing masks, should not be dissuaded by a few people who are not. No legal challenges to the emergency COVID orders have been successful. 
* Some Seattle grocery stores have not been enforcing mask orders, despite being reported more than once? They will be ""getting a call."" Vast majority will come into compliance after that, the rest would be sanctioned.",1,1593731811,washington,2020-07-02 17:16:51

I find so much mixed information in the public spectrum, similar to the months leading our Covid-19 start, and it seems that everything seems to be stamped by confirmation bias, based on the source.   But I really am concerned about why, for example, they keep testing my forehead temps and asking me the standard questions when I went to get x-rays yesterday, or when I went to consult with a surgeon, why it was very formal, almost like a 'gate keeper' approach, about my standard symptoms, yes or no.   Yet, we hear so much about the large % of asymptomatic.  

So, if the facts are that if  you are an  asymptomatic carrier, you simply do not pass it along, and that it is really only those who have the standard, common, ""Federally approved"" (tongue in cheek), symptoms, then why can't we talk about this loudly, and clearly?

That said, it is worrying to see the daily number of new cases spike on a weekend which is typically a slow reporting time.

New law means business and services do not have to serve low income or homeless (too poor to wear or afford a mask)

New law means businesses and services do not have to serve minorities (too fearful of wearing a mask for fear of being mistaken as criminal)

New law means polices can fine both, charge with a misdemeanor and take them straight to jail (or keep them on forever probation)

New law may finally remove both from the city permanently as they are no longer welcome to participate in commerce

This solves so many issues for Seattle business owners, residents, and police. Welcome to the new world of unintended consequences...",0,1594062632,washington,2020-07-06 13:10:32

CoronavirusWA,Sk-yline1,Herd Immunity,"It’s been sadly clear many people don’t seem to understand that achieving herd immunity naturally is impossible at this point unless we keep partial lockdowns for several years. 

BUT, now I’m starting to realize these people either don’t actually understand what herd immunity entails, or they’re wilfully lying to themselves. I think there’s a mindset that you can touch a bunch of surfaces and find many ways to repeatedly expose yourself to the virus in small doses so that you build up immunity, like how in The Princess Bride, Westley builds up an immunity to poison.

I think what people aren’t getting is the only way to get immunity is to get sick, and that means being wiped out for 8 days in “mild cases”, hospitalized in severe cases.

CoronavirusWA,JealousTask9,Cloth masks are wishful thinking .. according to science,"Why do we keep trying to pretend cloth masks are just as good as respirator masks? See below...

What’s interesting to me is if you look at the references that were listed on under their recommendation, none of them have anything to do with masks or the performance of masks or the performance of their filters or any of that. They’re all references related to pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission. I didn’t get the message there entirely, but I was glad to see is that they recognized that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission are happening. My message would have been if those were the references I was looking at, is maybe we should actually be encouraging people to stay home more. My biggest problem with telling people they can wear masks is it gives you this false sense of security. And it might even encourage you to think that now you’re protected and you’re protecting people around you. My husband and I try to take a walk every afternoon, just to get out, get a little bit of fresh air and exercise. **And I’m seeing more and more people now wearing cloth masks on the streets. And I don’t go to stores anymore, but my understanding is they’re wearing them there as well. I don’t have a problem with people wearing them. I just want them to understand that they aren’t very much more protective than if they weren’t wearing them. And they’re really not doing a whole lot of good for the people around them. So, we should continue to do social distancing as much as we possibly can**. I have places that are saying that you actually have to wear them. New York where you’re supposed to wear them anytime you’re in contact with people. I don’t know. I just think it’s not recognizing that the mode of transmission for this organism is likely small aerosols and close range and wearing a cloth mask shouldn’t give you any feeling of safety for being close to people. It shouldn’t make you feel that you’re not generating small particles because you still are. And since we none of us know if we’re infected or infectious, many of us probably are and aren’t going to have symptoms because we know that that’s the case for at least some fraction of the population that we’re putting everyone around us at risk. And especially the people I most care about are the workers. Our essential workers are really key to our success in flattening the curve. And they’re the ones who make it possible for us to stay home and be isolated those of us who are privileged enough to have that opportunity. **But we go out and think that we are doing something good for the public and the workers, and we’re actually not. I think we put them at more risk. So, I don’t understand the CDC’s recommendations for this. My guess is that there’s a lot of political pressure. And no government agency is entirely immune from political pressure.** There’s pressure to open, right? There’s pressure to restart the economy. I understand that entirely. **And so I think the feeling was, probably if we give everybody a mask, we can just reopen and everything’s going to be fine. I think we’re going to be shocked to find that that’s not going to work.** And I mean, I won’t be shocked, but there will be lots of people who will be shocked. And in fact, I read an article recently about a funeral. A number of people who attended the funeral. They were all wearing masks. They were taking photos next to each other. They were talking and a number of people got infected. S**o, it’s very clear these things do no good.** 

My conversations with people these days, I often point out that what we’re seeing is a lot of magical thinking. A lot of wishful thinking. Cloth masks are wishful thinking. **And people saying, well, they worked in Asia. There’s no evidence that they worked in Asia. In fact, it’s very clear that the healthcare workers in China, they may have been wearing cloth masks to start with, but when you look at pictures of what they were wearing later, they were wearing respirators.** **They were wearing full face gear and body gear and gloves**. **It was clear that even surgical masks weren’t working in healthcare settings or controlling COVID-19**. I don’t understand it. The Asian countries wear masks for societal and cultural reasons, not because they actually think they’re protecting. I’m not an expert in epidemiology. So, I will leave the modeling to the to those who know more about how this is going to work, but I do know my history. **And if you read about the 1918 influenza and the pandemic, it took almost two years for that to be completely done with. They did a lot of similar things. They closed down. They opened again. Then they had to close down and then they had to open again. Now, granted, they didn’t have a lot of what we have today. But in some ways, we’re not all that different from 1918. We don’t have any testing. We don’t have any contact tracing. They didn’t either. They didn’t even really know about that. They didn’t know much about viruses. So, we have huge amounts of scientific information. But we have almost no infrastructure anymore in public health.** Without our infrastructure in public health and our resources to do contact tracing and testing…. And testing, I mean with tests that really work that are both highly specific and highly sensitive. And we don’t have any of those yet. In many ways we’re being forced to make many of the same decisions that were made during the 1918 influenza pandemic. And the results are going to be similar. We are trying to decide when to open it back up. No one really knows the perfect answer to that. The models, they’re not perfect, right? I know infection preventionists are often pulled in two directions. One is they have to worry about patients. The other is they have to worry about workers. And sometimes the things you do for patients don’t work for workers and sometimes the other way around. That’s why I recommend including your health and safety people, industrial hygienists, and others, because they can give you that perspective about workers that will help you make good decisions for both. And really, it should be a hand-in-hand decision making that goes on

The new cases even exceed the previous 752 case record on 3/29.

We can't read too much into the total volume of tests because the negative results always have delays and the bulk of negative results in today's numbers were certainly not conducted on the same day. That said, it's hard to feel good about a record breaking positive daily case tally.

The 11 new deaths today are higher than the five yesterday.

CoronavirusWA,Fancy_Situation,It is time to address Airborne Transmission of COVID-19,"I know some users on here exclusively read /r/LockdownSkepticism so I wanted to give them a chance to read actual science.

https://reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/hmgeo4/it_is_time_to_address_airborne_transmission_of/

Relevant comments:

&gt;	If there truly is airborne (as opposed to droplet) transmission wouldn't the SAR be substantially higher in households?

&gt;	The comments from some of the authors and signatories from Twitter are clarifying to say that they a believe that airborne transmission is one of the routes. It may not be the primary route of transmission, but it needs to be accepted as a route. The body of evidence currently being required to accept airborne as a route is certainly higher than that for fomites.

&gt;	From my understanding, airborn can be transmitted via tiny aerosol droplets (like those created through normal respiration) droplet transmission is via larger droplets (like those found when a person coughs or sneezes). The larger droplets fall to the ground much quicker, vs the aerosols which can float around a room for quite some time.

&gt;	This is basically correct, although there are many variables at play. Ambient temperature, humidity, solar radiation and air currents play important roles. I think it is best considered as a continuum. There are no hard stops between droplet and aerosol routes of transmission.

CoronavirusWA,tenthousandthousand,Summary of Inslee's July 7 press conference - Washington at the crossroads between masks and shutdowns,"* Thousands of people still do not have unemployment claims processes. Inslee recognizes ""sincere frustration."" Team at ESD is working ""as hard as humanly possible"" to expedite this. Claims in the queue have gone from 81k to 30k over the past month. Vast majority of people who have filed have had their claims processed. New technologies developed and many more people hired.
* ""I want businesses open. I want more people back to work.""
* We know what works: masks, distancing, handwashing, speaking to contact tracers. Statewide mask order becomes official today. Local leaders in both east and west Washington are reporting significant increases in mask usage. Yakima usage of masks is now up to 90% in some places. 
* If contact tracers reach out to you, assist them. If they tell you to isolate, you need to isolate for the full 14 days. Infections can happen with no symptoms.
* **If we do not increase our mask usage, we may have to seriously consider partially closing down again.**
* We are in the ""bottom of the third inning"" and not anywhere close to done fighting COVID. But this is a ""good news press conference"" because we do have the tools to fight this. Inslee prefers to focus on successes, we know these strategies can work.
* Increasing surge of young people being infected is very concerning. Young people can die, they can pass it on to others. Groups of eight or twelve people hanging out together outdoors is far too dangerous.
* Positive percentage of tests has consistently increased. 3.8% in mid-June, 5% at the end of June and even higher this last week. WHO says that if it is higher than 5%, restrictions should not be lifted, ""we will keep that in mind.""
* Hospital admissions are also being seen throughout the state. If this increases through the summer, hospitals could be full of COVID patients by the fall, which would put us in a bad position for a second wave and/or the start of the school year.
* Disease activity increases because people are more in contact with each other. Unfortunately this is happening in many different settings - household contacts, long-term care facilities, food processing plants, retail, restaurants, childcare.
* Anyone who has any symptoms must self-isolate and get tested immediately. Anyone who is out and about with mild symptoms has probably infected several other people. 
* Anyone who is in contact with someone who tested positive must self-isolate for the full 14 days even if they test negative. It could take up to 14 days for symptoms to manifest. (This was contradicted later in the press conference, saying that two-week period can be cut short if they test negative.)
* ""We will not be successful in controlling spread if only half our population follows these measures.""
* UW is looking at a hybrid model of in-person and online classes that will allow international students to remain. (New orders from ICE say that international students cannot stay in the US if their college moves to online-only instruction.)
* Questions from press:
* Assistance for business who may face an increase in non-compliant/confrontational customers? ""We really hope that is not the case."" If customers are not wearing masks, employees should not ring up the sale. No need for physical confrontations. If someone says they are medically exempt, that will be accepted.
* Response to Freedom Foundation lawsuit on legitimacy of statewide order? ""Anyone can file a lawsuit who wants to waste their money."" We are on very firm legal ground.
* What is the difference between March/April and now? Cases are even higher than back then? We are trying to replace a total shutdown with other tools. We can succeed if people adhere to these rules. Will hopefully allow businesses to reopen while also preventing overload at hospitals. Cases have decreased this last week in Yakima, possibly a reflection of masking efforts. 
* Why is state stuck at a lower rate of testing (20 tests per positive case instead of the goal of 50)? Testing has increased dramatically over the last few weeks. COVID cases have also gone up. New drive-thru test sites will be set up this week in Yakima/Benton/Franklin. Exploring partnerships with larger pharmacy chains. Encouraging more people to come in for tests with even minor symptoms. Testing numbers should decline in the next week.
* Will enough Washington residents follow protocols without stricter stay-at-home restrictions? Inslee believes people will rise to the occasion. Using masks is a small thing where everyone can do their part to help.
* Specific metrics to decide if counties need to roll back? As said many times before, no single metric. Number of cases, positivity rate, hospitilization rates, death rate, hospital/ICE capacity, hospital transport, and now level of compliance with masks. 
* How long do we have before we need to consider locking down? We really believe that if mask usage and limiting social interaction increases, the graphs will flatten. Predictions are highly dependent on behaviors, modeling groups do not like predicting more than two weeks in advance.
* In Spokane and other nearby areas, tests are taking up to ten days to come back, any way to increase testing efficiency? People need to isolate even before they get test results. Federal government has never given us enough adequate test kits. Labs are also backlogged because of ""governors in southern states who listened to Donald Trump"" and have overloaded the lab capacity. We are also working with two more laboratories in eastern Washington to allow for more tests to go through those labs.
* Do you still have confidence in the leadership of ESD? Many changes have been made to catch up with the massive amount of new claims. ESD is doing everything possible to increase the capacity of this system. No system anywhere could suddenly process ten times as many claims in an efficient way.
* How many cases coming from Lewis-McChord? Has not been publicly reported, we have not seen that data.
* Will more specific information be released about larger outbreaks? Report about outbreaks, broken out by type of business, should be available soon.
* Possibility of not going to phase 4 this summer, cancelling Washington State Fair and concerts? It is a possibility. Better days will come because more people are wearing masks every day.
* In March there was a hotline for businesses that did not shut down, does a similar hotline exist now for lack of mask compliance? Go to the website coronavirus.wa.gov, you can report there. This is a legally binding order and businesses are mandated to comply.
* Will professional baseball be allowed (without fans) even though it is not allowed until phase 3 and King County is in phase 2? Inslee does not have an answer yet, will get back to us on that one.
* Why are businesses staying open when they have positive cases, it was not this way early in the pandemic? Some businesses are still closing for infections even if it is not reported in the media. Masks significantly cut transmission rate, as well as Plexiglas, social distance markings, and other measures. But there is also significant transmission outside the workplace in social gatherings.
* People from all over came to the coast for July 4, very few masks observed, why did the state not order beaches closed? We have to rely on people's common sense. Many people can be safely on a beach and observe social distancing. Washington beaches were not as bad as California or Jersey beaches. 
* Some businesses are not doing mass testing in the case of outbreaks? Local health departments can compel that testing. Every outbreak response is a little different, need to figure out a building's physical layout, who they were in actual close contact with. Some businesses need to close for broad testing.
* Response to people who say that mask order is unconstitutional? Bring it to the courts, they have consistently ruled that it is legal.",1,1594161441,washington,2020-07-07 16:37:21

CoronavirusWA,Officer_shagnasty,Can we talk about speaking up for masks?,"It’s hard. It’s kinda itchy. Some people wear the same dirty mask and hate it. Some don’t even have a mask or surgeon mask. And so what do we get as a result?

We get car salesmen meeting 20 people a day and spreading it, we get convenience stores with clerks who serve random people, not to mention crack heads where I’ve seen don’t have the best sanitary conditions go on and out. we have gatherings at the beach with people passing by, drinking, smoking, all while nobody is wearing a mask? 

And you know the hardest part is saying something. There was over 1,000 cases in Washington alone yesterday, and were close to reaching almost 1 in 100 have Covid, and we probably already reached that or more due to unreporting and slow symptoms / spread. 

So how do I protect myself? 

Lead By Example.
1. Wear a mask and wear a nice one or have a few (I prefer having 5, one for each day). You can find these relatively cheap online or buy locally from the hundreds of people making them!

2. Tell your loved ones to wear a mask. I know it seems crazy but sometimes your family aren’t the brightest crayons in the box. If they are stigmatic, the key is to just calmly remind them that it’s good to wear a mask. Don’t push people or force anyone otherwise they might start to fight you (especially on Facebook). 

3. Remind people in public, when appropriate, to wear a mask. It might seem rude or pushy, but really it’s just keeping us all safe in this fight against the Corona virus together. Some of you may only go out very little, but what if you caught CoVid-19 the one time you went grocery shopping for the month, went safely, sanitized and washed, but somehow still caught Covid? It’s a harsh reality, but this is a reality we face together and if we’re smart, we can beat.

Well, that’s the end of my talk. I guess you could say it’s as easy as 123. Be safe everyone!",1,1594164940,washington,2020-07-07 17:35:40

The 435 new cases is a big drop from the 1,087 yesterday on a much lower volume of tests (6,268 people tested on 7/6 vs 16,550 on 7/5).

It is obvious that daily results are subject to big swings due to delays that crop up in the reporting processes at various counties and labs, which result in spikes when the department of health catches up. It's hard to read much into today's big decline in cases and tests considering the big increases we've been seeing recently. The lesson here is that we need to look at weekly averages to get a real understanding of trends.

The 14 new deaths are higher than the 11 yesterday.

Masks and face coverings don’t work to protect you from giving/getting corona in the currently used form.

Why? not to save them from the “virus” SO THEY CAN GO BUY FOOD AND SUPPLIES FOR THEMSELVES AND GET AROUND THIS POINTLESS AND DISCRIMINATORY POLICY. We did and I’m making it my personal mission to make sure every Ballard person in need gets a mask so stores stop denying them the right to eat Ballard folks: in case you didn’t notice, we’ve got a lot more new neighbors in the park - it’s a great time to say “howdy”. 

We may not agree that they work, but we do agree that people should have the right to participate in commerce without proper support from the people imposing this unnecessary restriction.

I did some googling, and all of the places where you could easily sign up online (I.e. the Aurora location) didn’t have testing available until Wednesday. Decided to check out UW and paid $35 to have a virtual session to get authorized for a test. Doctor authorizes it, I call to schedule, nothing till Wednesday. She says we can still go to the Rainier Beach location today but it’s just first come first serve and there may be a wait. We decide to give it a try.

It was unclear if they open for testing at 930 or 10, but we decide we want to be early, so we got there around 9am. The line didn’t look that bad - maybe 50-60 cars in front of us?

It’s 1:15pm. We are still in line. Our toddler is seriously unhappy lol. No bathrooms. Eating the snacks we brought.  11 cars in front of us, we have made it into the parking lot.

CoronavirusWA,JC_Rooks,King County Daily Report (7/11),"**King County Daily Report (7/11)**

The Washington State data system is down for maintenance today, so I don't think there will be a state update from /u/secondsniglet. It'll be back late afternoon on July 12. However, King County's data system is still going, and made an early update. So here's today's King County report!

**New stats since yesterday**

* New positive cases: 139 (down 7 since yesterday), with 68 assigned to yesterday
* New tests: 1,157 (down 1,878 since yesterday), with 69 assigned to yesterday
* New hospitalizations: 13 (mostly applied to older dates, 7/8 and earlier)
* New deaths: 0

**7-Day Moving Totals and Averages**

* 897 total cases (rate of 40.3 per 100K residents)
* 128.1 average over the past 7 days (rate of 5.8 per 100K residents)
* 4.0% average positive test rate over the past 7 days
* Charts: [https://imgur.com/a/KS2BnUz](https://imgur.com/a/KS2BnUz)
* NOTE: Since 7/10 is a partial day, I've excluded that from the calculations. However, the numbers are slightly different from yesterday's report, since the county regularly updates earlier cases.

**Cities with the highest number of newly reported cases:**

* Seattle: 35 cases, 4.7 per 100K residents
* Federal Way: 19 cases, 19.4 per 100K residents
* Kent: 19 cases, 14.6 per 100K residents
* Auburn: 11 cases, 15.3 per 100K residents
* SeaTac: 8 cases, 27.4 per 100K residents
* Kirkland: 6 cases, 6.7 per 100K residents
* NOTE: These are newly reported cases, not ""yesterday's cases"". This often includes data going back a few days. Use the dashboard below, to get the best picture for how a particular city is doing.

The county dashboard updated really early today (7 AM). The downward trend continues to look good. However, since it's now the weekend, it shouldn't be a surprise that numbers are lower across the board. We did break 4k tests again on 7/8, so it's good to see that the lowered testing on 7/5-7/6 (less than 2k each) was just a fluke.

In terms of cities, Lakeland North and Maple Valley have been trending up recently. This is not surprising, since the South/Southwest areas of the county continue to be a bit of a ""hot spot"", and these cities are near Auburn and Kent, which regularly have double-digit cases. According to the demographics data in the dashboard, these cities tend to have a higher distribution of Hispanic and Black residents getting infected, as well as a younger age group. My theory is that these are, unfortunately, essential workers that are picking it up from their jobs. Seattle and Eastside communities tend to be much more affluent, and tech workers (myself included) have the luxury of working from home.

**Fun fact:** The bridge that connects Seattle and Medina across Lake Washington is officially called the Governor Albert D. Rosellini Bridge at Evergreen Point.

I took my kids and fam down to hit dash point trail today and ran into so many douchebags without masks. Single track 3' wide trail in many places. I get it we are outdoors but when your running or just walking by and breathe right into my face, that makes you the definition of an asshole. Or even better the person that intentionally tries to talk to you because youre wearing a mask and they literally stand in the middle of the trail so you have to walk right by them. These people don't have an ounce of courtesy for others. I don't care what the excuse is, I'm over being nice about it.  

On the other hand 90% of people were inspiringly polite and considerate. They pull up their masks when crossing paths  or they would walk off the trail a bit and face away from us. Absolute class!

I have an Israeli gas mask I would like to use there but I am somewhat concerned about causing an alarm. It looks like a Dr. Who reference. I'm going to be wearing my usual clothes with it. A blue sweater and a Totoro satchel (psychologically, wearing blue makes you appear less agressive. Weird huh?). 

It's *Walmart* where the unusual happens right? I went to do grocery shopping about a week ago at Safeway, but there were surprisingly an abundance of people not following proper procedure or wearing masks.

As much as I love *Walmart*, some ratchets frequent there. It's like comparing a nightclub with cheap or free entry (*Walmart*) with an expensive one (except Safeway is more mid-tier). The pricing of the products acts like a barrier between crowds therefore I can expect even more people to not follow procedure at *Walmart*.

Perhaps I'm being too cautious, but I don't want to compromise my health nor the sense of safety from others. We're all strangers afterall.

While this is only one specific instance, would it also be socially acceptable to use a gas mask in various other areas?

CoronavirusWA,wiggityweed420,"BWW Olympia, WA - not enforcing guidelines. UFC 251","It's embarrassing how poorly this business is handling the safety of patrons, and employees.

Last night they had UFC 251 playing live in the restaurant, and it was packed! Not only was the restaurant packed, but also the patio which is a closed air extension of the building was also packed.
The patio at this location is close, with sliding glass windows. Maybe 2-3 windows were opened?

Almost no masks to be seen anywhere, I saw maybe two people wearing masks in a crowded restaurant other than employees.

Bartops were banned under the new guidelines to keep people from congregating for hours in a closed air building, but instead they thought it was a good idea to run an extremely hyped UFC fight lasting 3+ hours and filling the restaurant, while just pushing tables up against the bar top.

I cant in any world see how this is acceptable or responsible.

On top of this, the business has already received a call from L&amp;I about how lax they've been with their mask policies.

Businesses need to do better at protecting employees and patrons. Instead, they are taking the easy way out, to avoid confrontation. We need to hold these businesses accountable for their negligence.

As such, the numbers reported on 7/12 include both 7/10 and 7/11 statistics.*

The 1,438 new cases are far higher than the 637 reported on 7/9, but since no numbers were reported yesterday these new statistics are catching up for two days. That said, this works out to 719 new cases across 7/10 and 7/11 which is on the high range of what we've seen during the pandemic. This was on a volume of 17,539 people tested (split across two days it works out to 8,770 people tested each day).

The 14 new deaths is close to the 15 reported on 7/9 but it is a lower number when split across the last two days.

For today's personal anecdote, on my daily bike ride around Lake Sammamish I see that the lakeside SAMBICA summer camp is up and going. I see lots of kids and counselors doing close quarters activities (no social distancing here). I find it bizarre to see that the counselors are wearing masks, but none of the kids are. I don't much see the point of the adults wearing masks if the sea of campers are bare faced.

Even creepier, was hearing counselors lead a large grouping of kids in a series of enthusiastic cheers at the top of their lungs. I guess no one has heard about how the vocal exertions of choir participants is an ideal environment for spreading coronavirus.

Thanks to the folks who participated and contributed to the 247 responses in this survey. 

-----------------

There were three reasons for putting up the survey:

1. To get verification that actions already being taken by the mods seemed generally reasonable to the community at large.
   * Allowing ""government criticism"", removing ""medical information"", and allowing ""policy understanding questions"" were in this bucket and generally supported by the community. 
2. To see if meta moderation actions would be valuable.
   * ""More stringent enforcement for repeated offenders"", ""using ability to take feedback as moderation consideration"", and ""having periodic moderator summaries of enforcement actions"" were in this group and generally supported by the community. 
3. To get a pulse on the community's feelings toward tricky moderation topics as data for figuring out appropriate policies for enforcement.
    * ""Medical speculation (that may not strictly be misinformation)"", ""Medically supported statements, but presented in an inflammatory matter"", ""Posts shaming of specific groups/individuals"" were in this category. The community had some weak preferences on these, but were overall fairly split.

Based on this, we will continuing doing the items in #1 above, start doing the items in #2, and continue trying to figure out the best way of dealing with the items in #3. 

------------------------------------------------------------

I also did read through all 64 of the free-form responses. Responding to a few of them in specific:

&gt; Could we have a limit on new accounts or accounts with low karma? I think that could allow us to interact with more real people as opposed to accounts with a single purpose. 

Already in place and has been for a while. The Automod does have a false positive rate (resulting in us having to periodically check and fish things out of it) but it has caught some egregious spam. 

&gt; It would be cool if we could geo-target or at least make it harder for anything that is an obvious troll.  Brand new accounts from a vpn out of germany just sowing division. 

Geo-targeting/filtering by IP is a power that only the Reddit admins have. Overall, mods are pretty limited in the tools given by Reddit site admins for enforcement. (Can go into more detail in the comments if folks are curious.)

There were also quite a few comments about how medical misinformation will be defined, censorship, and flairing threads rather than removing them -- these are prime candidates for longer discussion, so will post them as top-level comments below. 

Thread announcing the survey, which also has some good discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusWA/comments/hhv010/help_the_mods_figure_out_how_to_deal_with_grey/

---------------------------------------------------

Some other interesting things from running the survey:
* While ""definitely remove"" was by far and large the winning preference with regards to ""medical misinformation"", the first 10 or so votes after I posted the survey were all ""definitely keep"" votes.
    * Not sure if this is brigading, fake behavior, or just certain folks of certain opinions being more online when I posted the original thread. However, I have noticed this sort of ""heavily biased initial commenting/voting that then gets normalized out"" as a trend on the sub for a while now.",1,1594625176,washington,2020-07-13 01:26:16

They are currently advocating for teachers to go back in the fall with the idea that kids will come in blocks each day on. 2 day a week schedule with the rest of the learning being distance. They propose schools are cleaned on the weekend. Why do they think this will work? Arizona held Summer School with 3 teachers doing distance learning, two got sick and one died. How do they think our archaic public schools that are already understaffed and overly full will be able to accommodate distanced students?  They say masks will be mandatory but with how low their budgets are (and with the firing of staff already due to budget issues) do they plan on buying masks for the poor students? On the topic of poor diacritics are they ready and equipped to pay for all medical care related to the virus when they fail to protect their workers and students from the virus? The virus can cause permanent damage so are they ready to pay for the lifetimes of care some people damaged by the virus may need? What about death settlements?

The testing volume was high today. 23,370 people were tested on 7/12 vs 17,539 on 7/11, which was a catch up day making today's record volume of testing stand out even more.

The negative 39 deaths today is impossible to make sense of. The department of health web site state they are cleaning up previously counted COVID deaths that have been re-categorized as natural.

I don't how to see the huge growth in new cases as anything but worrisome. I just *really* wish more people would wear masks when they are anywhere close to other people.

CoronavirusWA,tenthousandthousand,"Summary of Inslee's July 14 press conference - the current spread of COVID in this state is ""not sustainable""","* Latest survey in Yakima County shows 95% mask usage. Case numbers in Yakima, transmission rate, hospitalizations all declining. Masks are working in Washington State.
* Cases are still growing statewide, dramatically over the last month. Now worse than at any other time this year. Other states have been forced to close their businesses. We are not in as bad a position as those other states, but we will be in a bad position unless we can avert our course.
* R0 is likely over 1.5 in western Washington.
* **We will continue our pause in reopening phases until at least July 28.**
* Our actions over the next couple of weeks will directly impact whether the virus is prevalent enough for us to feel comfortable in sending children back to school in the fall.
* Very concerning to see that far more people in their 20s are being affected. They could infect others who are older, or who are immunosuppressed. At the same time, we are aware that the jobs in that age bracket tend to put them in contact with more members of the public. 
* The actions of businesses alone will not stop this. The ""battle will be won or lost"" in the presence or absence of large group social gatherings.
* We should be hopeful. More mask wearing means that soon we will need less social distancing. 
* ""People should not be surprised if more gets rolled back depending on the course of this pandemic."" There is a ""significant chance"" that the restrictions of California and Oregon will come here as well. It all depends on usage of masks and social distancing.
* **We hope that social distancing and masking will be sufficient, but we understand that those may not be enough.**
* Grateful to hear that ICE has reversed the decision that would have forced international students taking online courses to leave the country.
* Questions from press:
* How many complains have been sent to the state about non-compliant businesses? Inslee does not have the specific numbers on hand. No enforcement against anti-mask businesses has happened yet. Inslee is grateful to the business leaders who have stepped up to help with this.
* Obstacles to contact tracing? It is partially done through local departments and partially at the state level. Finishing training for even more National Guard members due to increasing case count. Increasing outbreaks strain our resources.
* Where are these outbreaks specifically occurring? Throughout the state, in a wide variety of settings and many different types of businesses. This makes targeted interventions difficult. Very likely that the disease is widespread in our communities. No one specific industry to target. Vital that everyone limits their social interactions and wears masks. In phase 2 counties you should not be in contact with more than 5 people per week, you must be wearing masks and those gatherings should be outside if at all possible. 
* Which metrics will guide specific decisions in the coming days? ""If I could pick three:"" positivity rate of testing (gone from 4% to 8% on some days), total case count (double where it was several weeks ago), hospitalization rate (both overall people in the hospital and COVID patients). Other metrics affect this as well. We are seeing a steady climb instead of an explosion, which could lull us into a false sense of security. We need to figure out something in the next few days to slow and then reverse that dynamic. 
* Where, precisely, would those numbers need to be to justify a rollback? Enough to convince us that the rate of infections was constant or reversing, not increasing. Inslee receives daily epidemiological reports and studies them closely. 
* Where did the negative 39 deaths come from yesterday? A report will be published today that goes into more detail. We collect lab results from people who tested positive, if that person dies it is marked as a death, and then we examine the death certificate. 90% have COVID as the cause of death, remaining 10% are unsure or die of a natural cause which we believe is attributable to COVID. If the local health department determines otherwise, then we remove the death from the counter. This is a very small percentage of the total number and should not impact our overall decisions. We are also certain that people are dying of COVID and whose deaths are never recorded. 
* What exactly does it mean to take a step backwards? At this point that is still a possibility, not a certainty. But our current situation is unsustainable. These possibilities could potentially include a new ban on indoor dining, but nothing has been decided at this time.
* Are courts and jury trials following health department regulations? They worked together very closely to develop guidance. Risk of courtroom transmission depends significantly on local community transmission overall. 
* Plans for schooling in the fall? Current plan is to have in-person schooling at the local districts' discretion. Could potentially include part-time schooling if the districts make that decision, or online schooling. We are still on that track. It depends upon the course of the virus, which in turn depends on our actions.
* Hospitalizations and deaths are increasing far slower than the case count? Likely because a far younger population is being infected now. They are less likely to be hospitalized. We are still concerned because hospitalizations are increasing, even if at a slower rate. But when the younger populace begins to transfer the disease to their parents and grandparents, a hospitalization ""explosion"" would follow. Inslee says that it's very seductive to see a mild increase each day and think it's not so bad, when if you look at the larger trends over the past few weeks it is far more concerning. Improved medical treatment is also a factor in lower hospitalization rates.
* Did anything open up too soon? We made good decisions based on science and also on economic pain. Only time we can affect the future is right now. We always knew that the process would be iterative. 
* With hospital layoffs, will they be able to meet demand? Our capacity and surge capacity are listed in the online dashboards. We have adequate levels of both right now, but we will run out if current trends continue.
* Any cases of children becoming sick, or passing it to adults? Children are becoming infected in Washington, proportion of infected 10-19 year olds in King County exactly matches the overall infected proportion, slightly less in other counties. Children are less likely to have severe or any symptoms, less likely (but not absolutely guaranteed) to pass it to others. Running the numbers shows us that if school started right now, many kids would be sick in the schools. 
* Concerns specifically about bars and parties? Virus only spreads via direct human contact, anything that amplifies that makes it worse. Cannot give exact percentages with bars relative to other parties, but it does happen in both settings. 
* How best to stop people congregating in large groups in social settings? Widespread use of masks will help slow spread, but the virus is in too deep to rely just on masking initiatives. Communication campaigns with the public will start in the next few days to explain the necessity of masks and social distancing. 
* Will the eviction moratorium be extended, or a renter relief package? Strongly being considered, no finalized information to share at this time.
* Average turnaround time for tests is now up to seven days, how does this impact compact tracing? Those are from commercial labs which are only 20% of our total lab results. Federal government assistance is needed to ensure that test reagents do not run short.",211,1594765951,washington,2020-07-14 16:32:31
CoronavirusWA,secondsniglet,"Washington state - 547 new cases - 42,304 cases total - 7/13/2020 Case Updates","The 547 new cases is a big drop from the 1,101 yesterday on a much lower volume of testing (8,859 people tested on 7/13 vs 23,370 on 7/12). It is likely that the record breaking daily count on 7/12 was due in part to old data finally making it's way into the system. Of course, that means that previous days were under-counted.

The five new deaths is a big increase over the negative 49 yesterday, but since yesterday's numbers were due to department of health data cleansing a comparison isn't very useful. Five deaths is still lower than the 15 range we saw from 7/8 through 7/11.

CoronavirusWA,bambityslam,Future of Buffets," I made a post asking about buffets on jun 27th, regarding whether or not they are allowed to open. The general consensus was that it wasn't. However, apparently, on june 25th, there was a clarification with self service bars. 

b) Restaurants and taverns in Phase 2 or beyond are now permitted to resume self-service buffets, salad bars, salsa bars, and other similar communal food sources and drink stations, subject to the business:

1. Strictly complying with all Phase 2 and Phase 3 restaurant requirements;
2. Ensuring the use of antimicrobial hand sanitizer by customers before and after handling serving utensils;
3. Installing permanent barriers, such as sneeze guards, to protect food; and
4. Monitoring the communal food and beverage areas to ensure that customers maintain physical distancing and all other rules.

It's a little bit surprising to me that buffets were allowed to open with a self-service model again especially in phase 2 areas.

This was something I didn't know until recently. I know at least 3 buffets that opened recently to self service, some requiring gloves and mask. Does anyone think Washington will roll back any phases? Especially with the pause in further re-openings.

Just sent out to Fred Meyer employees and posted on the internal news site.

""Throughout the pandemic, we have made your health and well-being a top priority. We have required our associates to wear masks for some time, and now, in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases across the country, we will extend that requirement to our customers. Beginning Wednesday, July 22, customers will be required to wear a facial covering in our stores, regardless of local or state mandates. We are taking this extra step now because we recognize additional  precautions are needed to protect our country. We will spend the next week preparing signage and materials to help our stores effectively and consistently communicate this requirement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that wearing facial coverings, combined with social distancing and frequent handwashing, is a proven method to further reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus. To be most effective, associates are asked to set a positive example and ensure their masks are properly covering both their nose and mouth.

This requirement will follow the same processes we have implemented in areas where customer masks are already required, while allowing us to create a more consistent experience across the organization. We respect and recognize that some customers, due to medical reasons, may not be  able to wear a mask (small children are exempt). These customers will be encouraged to consider an alternative option like a face shield or use  our ecommerce services like Pickup or Delivery. Additional guidance and materials will be provided to store leaders and associates within the coming days.

Your safety is important, and in the current environment, some customers may react emotionally or be frustrated with this change. To help you be more prepared to manage tense situations as they occur,  please reference these tips for de-escalation. \[link removed\]

CoronavirusWA,7eid,CDC: Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19,"This visualization, updated by the CDC on Wednesday, includes several different estimates:

* **Number of excess deaths:** A range of estimates for  the number of excess deaths was calculated as the difference between the  observed count and one of two thresholds (either the average expected  count or the upper bound of the 95% CI), by week and jurisdiction.  Negative values, where the observed count fell below the threshold, were  set to zero.
* **Percent excess:** The percent excess was defined as the number of excess deaths divided by the threshold.
* **Total number of excess deaths:**The total number of  excess deaths in each jurisdiction was calculated by summing the excess  deaths in each week, from February 1, 2020 to present. Similarly, the  total number of excess deaths for the US overall was computed as a sum  of jurisdiction-specific numbers of excess deaths (with negative values  set to zero), and not directly estimated using the Farrington  surveillance algorithms.

What it does suffer from is a month-long time lag, so the current spike isn't factored in.

The total excess range for the United States is 124,892 - 168,675.

For Washington state that range is 211-1010.

Anyways...They asked me a few questions and than asked if ao had any.

I asked ""if I go in tomorrow and test positive, do I go into another quarantine?""

They said ""No, as long as you're not showing symptoms than you can go back to work even if you test positive.""

Thirty (30) confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported to GCHD today. Case are residents of Ephrata, Mattawa, Moses Lake, Quincy, Royal City, and Warden. Demographics can be found above.

The graphs for exposure setting, employment sector, and clinical status have been updated. Only 15% of people tested have been asymptomatic. The majority of cases within Grant County are symptomatic. Social gatherings are continuing to be the exposure setting of many cases. It’s summer and the weather is great so we understand the desire to get together with friends and family, but now isn’t the time for it. People can share the virus with others 2 days before they feel sick meaning you could be sick and not know it. Attending a family BBQ or birthday party could mean you easily spread the illness to those you care about. Our choices matter. Choose not to get together.

My personal anecdote today is the half mile line of cars I saw waiting to get into Sammamish state park today while I did my daily bike ride around the lake. Everybody seems eager to crowd together and enjoy the sun, virus be damned.

By the way, I purposefully stay on the main roads when doing my bike rides specifically so I can avoid the people clogging the trails. I feel much safer being close to cars than people these days.

• Except for rare situations, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended to determine when to allow HCP to return to work.

• For HCP with severe to critical illness or who are severely immunocompromised, the recommended duration for work exclusion was extended to 20 days after symptom onset (or, for asymptomatic severely immunocompromised1 HCP, 20 days after their initial positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test).

•Other symptom-based criteria were modified as follows:

- Changed from “at least 72 hours” to “at least 24 hours” have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications
-Changed from “improvement in respiratory symptoms” to “improvement in symptoms” to address expanding list of symptoms associated with COVID-19

On my bike ride around lake Sammamish today I saw that the car line to get into Sammamish state park were only 1/4 mile long instead of the half mile yesterday, so I guess that's an improvement.

That said, the roads sure are busy. You wouldn't have a clue there was any kind of crisis going on judging by the traffic on I90 and roads on the Eastside. My serene bike rides on near empty roads from two months ago is just a memory now.

This is the data for Sunday, so keep in mind that weekend statistics are often low. Also, we really have to be careful calculating percentage positive numbers on a daily basis since the negative results are so much slower to be reported than the positive ones, meaning that the total volumes we report each day actually represent tests that may have happened at any day over the previous week. The weekly averages give us a much better idea of trends.

When I woke up I felt hot, and just off. I checked my temperature (with 2 thermometers) and it was 101. I thought I had some sort of fever reducer lying around but the only one I had was expired. I didn't want to go to the store in case I am positive, so I called a friend to see if they could just grab something for me on the way home from work.

CoronavirusWA,Alisa180,Staff Member At SeaTac Assisted Living Facility Tested Positive,"[The letter distributed to residents today](https://imgur.com/a/vMl39Z0)

Context: I'm a 28-year old female living in the only assisted living facility in the state that explicitly caters to non-seniors. We're in SeaTac, not far from the airport. 75% of us residents are under 65, with a wide range of ages. I'm far from  the only one in her late twenties here.

So far in this pandemic, we've avoided infection. Somehow. The nature of the facility means its normally a hive of activity, coming and going, and the staff took pride in somehow avoiding the virus before we locked down, effectively sealing us away. It was a miracle, really, though the lockdown was rough since again, we're a bunch of young adults-middle aged with a smattering of seniors. Our Internet (which was supposed to be upgraded right before the pandemic hit) sucks balls, so we couldn't stream Netflix without painful buffering, among other things... Put it all together and it was... not pretty. A few lost screws I don't they're getting back.

But I digress. We had just recently been allowed to leave the property and even kinda sorta have visitors again when this letter was distributed. Admin is pissed, since this staff member blew up all their hard work (Don't know who it is ''cause medical privacy). No resident has really been sick (we're regularly screened for temperature and oxygen). But given this thing's incubation time...

We may be mostly (Though I stress mostly) non-seniors, but many of us are vulnerable for other reasons. Smokers, diabetics, high blood pressure, the list goes on. I'll... *probably* be fine if infected, since I'm physically healthy and here for mental disorders rather then medical. A few others are on the 'will likely be fine list' but there are no garuntees...

There's no telling how bad this may be. Not only because we're a facility, but this is a facility of people who've been *out and about recently.* I can't garuntee all of them masked up despite rules, because managing this place is like herding cats. Some are idiots, but some are just inevitably a little out there, for good or ill.

The U.S. announces a nearly $2 billion contract for 600 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine.

The Trump administration on Wednesday announced a nearly $2 billion contract with the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and a smaller German biotechnology company for up to 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, with the companies on track to manufacture the first 100 million doses by December.

Under the arrangement, the federal government would obtain the first 100 million doses for $1.95 billion, with the rights to acquire up to 500 million more. Americans would receive the vaccine for free. Before it could be distributed, it would first need at least emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration.

Large-scale safety trials are to begin this month, with regulatory review set for as early as October.

“Depending on success in clinical trials, today’s agreement will enable the delivery of approximately 100 million doses of vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech,” Alex M. Azar II, the health secretary, said in a statement announcing the deal.",11,1595426056,washington,2020-07-22 07:54:16

CoronavirusWA,AlarmedWarthog2567,Anyone know how to report/discourage a large gathering at a childcare center?,"Throwaway account. Our county is currently in Phase 1.5, with a roll-back only allowing gatherings of up to 5 people. This childcare center I use is hosting an event tomorrow evening with political representatives and candidates as well as other childcare providers and parents. The gathering is being held inside their childcare facility with the doors open (there is a garage door on one wall). Although there will be plenty of fresh air and people are encouraged to wear masks and face shields I noticed today that they are also having the event catered, meaning people will have to remove their masks and be eating in close proximity to one another. I don't see the point of having to keep groups of kids separated in the classroom, restricting their play, and having them wear oversized t-shirts for protection (not sure why that would even help) if all the childcare providers and many others from the community are all in the same room. 

I fully support everyone's right to free speech and it is critical to address the importance of childcare and the additional challenges that it faces right now, but I worry this is not a safe way to do it. What's wrong with just a Facebook live or zoom event? Or not serving food? Or holding it in any location other than the one that will hold our children the next morning?

Anyone know if there is anything that can be done to report or discourage this?",13,1595443342,washington,2020-07-22 12:42:22
CoronavirusWA,slothscandance,WA ESD Claim Issues/Delays,"I'll start this off by apologizing if this isn't the place for this question (I'm assuming a few members may have experienced this).

Around March, my wife's clinic cancelled/postponed a fair amount of appointments to limit the number of staff. I want to say all of the nurses and practitioners were limited to 15-20 hours a week. My wife subsequently filed for unemployment benefits, entered her hours truthfully and accurately, and received benefits for roughly 3 - 4 weeks. She then returned to her normal schedule and stopped receiving benefits.

In May, she received a letter from ESD with a ton of fraud/over payment jargon and somewhere in the mix was the actual issue - she needed to confirm her identity; we also confirmed this was the issue on her SAW account which stated the same. I imagine this is linked to the hacking (or non-hacking depending on your source) of the department's system. Anyhow, she logged in and provided copies of her DL and SS card. Case closed (in our minds).

In June, she received letters stating she owes $4k with threats of garnishment of wages, tax return, etc. Her claim status still hadn't changed via her SAW account so she then filed an appeal in accordance with the letter's options and again attached copies of her credentials and a copy of her previous submission of the requested credentials. Come July, she received a letter stating her appeal would be seen before a judge. 

I'm fully aware of the department's backlog but I find it hard to believe that 2 attempts to satisfy their request would warrant these letters. From an IT perspective, I can't imagine the processes aren't 'talking' to each other. Neither of us has any experience with unemployment claims so maybe this is the normal process. Maybe this is simply 1M workers filing all at once; not sure.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips? Guidance?",5,1595445727,washington,2020-07-22 13:22:07

I have COPD, Heart Disease, Aortal Fibrolations and Lung Cancer, and my wife is a diabetic (mild) so if we get it we are uber at risk.

Is the hotel legally compelled, during Covid, to clean my room when their is no way to ensure no contamination? Like do we have to let them in , in other words. I dont want to get kicked out, but I will make an issue of it if i have to. I just want to know what ground i stand on.

CoronavirusWA,coolhandjiveforever,"With 20-25% of kids in private schools in Seattle and most privateschools trying to open, how to address?","Pulling my comment from another thread into a post. I would love some thoughts on whether people think this will be an issue or not? Any advice on talking to schools?

Maybe I’m overreacting... but there are Catholic elementary, middle, and high schools across the state pushing for opening without sharing their rationale of how to keep things safe. They aren’t using as much of the faith-based language that I’ve seen around “God will protect us” here to justify reopening, but they are pushing for opening without much evidence — the only scenario they are considering for not opening is if the Governor tells them not to open. The numbers are way worse than when they closed initially.

This is a problem for the Seattle area because something like 1 in 5 to 1 in 4 kids in Seattle go to private school. That’s 20-25% of kids in Seattle and the private schools (often faith-based) seem to be more likely using non-scientific reasons to open. I’m not sure about the rest of the state... But it’s clear without the state stepping in, it will be a patchwork of approaches.

Some private schools are talking about masks, others are talking about modified schedules, but they are pushing opening without good reasoning other than “we need to get kids learning again.” They also haven’t cited safety evidence. It’s unclear whether the interventions of modified schedules or masks will work, especially for high school and middle school where there is increased likelihood of passing on CV than little kids... let’s not forget all the teachers and support staff this puts at risk also. The reality is they likely have a set of wealthier, more conservative as a whole, and less science-based parent population (at least the vocal parents anecdotally) who are pressuring them to open instead of doing the right thing to keep people safe.

I heard schools like Holy Names Academy, Seattle Prep, St. Joseph, SAAS, (all cap hill), Assumption St Bridgett, St. Bernadette, Holy Family Kirkland, and others pushing to get kids back in school without discussing safety (don’t quote me on all because much of the info is second hand).

With 20-25% of kids in Seattle area in private schools, this is a bigger problem than many realize... the public schools can close and these will open up and put us all at risk... not sure the percentage across the state, but it’s likely higher than other states. Am I overreacting to think this isn’t smart to have all these private schools diverging from the public recommendation? That, coupled with the latest info coming out about the CDC essentially making a political recommendation for schools to open despite evidence that it won’t be safe, has me worried for Washington.",1,1595712488,washington,2020-07-25 15:28:08

Background: This friend of mine is working on the COVID floor of a UW hospital since this all started in March. I know for a fact that this person is not following any of the guidelines outside of work. Every weekend since March this person has been partying and living it up. Even during phase 1, they were going to house parties almost every weekend with large groups of people. When the weather got nice, they went to the beach, camping, hiking, and paddle boarding with large groups of people. Now that bars and restaurants are open, they’ve gone out almost every weekend. They’ve even traveled across the country twice (!!!) to state’s with mandatory 14 day quarantines. During those trips, they did not quarantine and continued to party. They also refuse to get tested. 

I’ve tried telling this person just how selfish and stupid they’re being but they immediately got defensive and told me to mind my business since they’re an “expert.” 

Any advice on how to handle this? Me and some other friends are extremely concerned.

CoronavirusWA,UpperLeftOriginal,Unemployment job search requirements waived until Aug 1 - will waiver be extended?,"Anyone have any insight on whether the waiver of the job search activities will be extended? As of now, anyone on unemployment can skip the usual requirement of recording 3 job search activities each week. But that ends after this week.

The rest of this post is just me rambling a little about our specific situation.

Hubs is on unemployment (his company is trying to re-open, but w/limited staffing, so he's SOL there). While he doesn't have to submit job search activities due to the waiver, he has been trying to find a job anyway. He's been kind of an odd-jobs guy for the past few years, after leaving his primary career in broadcast TV after Sinclair bought the station he was working for. But at 58 years old with 5 back surgeries under his belt, he's limited. Our transportation situation is also a little sketchy, so we're limited in how far away from home he can look.

Neither one of us have done unemployment before, so I'm concerned about whether he'll be able to find enough jobs to apply for because there's almost nothing appropriate available now. If he applies to jobs he can't really do, just to fill the requirement, that seems like a recipe for trouble if he ends up needing to turn down an offer of work because he can't do it anyway. (Not to mention a waste of time for the employer.)

We're fortunate that I'm able to keep working (office job, working from home) even though I did have to take a pay cut to keep my job. So we can pay the rent and groceries with my paycheck for now. Anything extra (doctors, car repairs, etc) comes from what he can bring in. With the unemployment benefit, we have also been able to fill in some $ gaps for our grown kids in Oregon (their unemployment processing backlog was INSANE and one of them still hasn't received his benefits - thankfully he was able to find a new job this week).",1,1595874103,washington,2020-07-27 12:21:43

Those were actual doctors trying to share medical information, and they have been censored by people with no medical background.

The fact that we have allowed medical information to become politicized is egregious.

It shouldn't matter which side of the political fence you're on, this is unacceptable. At no point should a bunch of silicon valley non-doctors be able to control what medical information is available.

At no point should the media be allowed to restrict the President or Congresspeople from addressing the public, especially in regards to a public health crisis.

Furthermore, what do you believe this does in the minds of the people who believe COVID is a hoax, or that contact tracing is a conspiracy? It simply reinforces their belief and can even galvanize them to spread misinformation.

Perhaps today's death spike was the result of re-classifying previous deaths much like we've seen the opposite happen with previously counted deaths being removed (causing negative daily counts). We will have to see if this spike in deaths is a one off event or that this higher count persists.

The overall King County numbers continue to look pretty good! Our % positivity rate continues to go down, and we're back down to under 1K total cases over the past week. Unfortunately, we aren't testing quite as much as we have before (still above 4K a day though), though it also means we're finding fewer positive cases too.

Even South King county looks like it's plateauing. Some cities might even be seeing a slight decline, though I think it's still a bit early to tell. At the very least, it's not the rapid growth we were seeing a few weeks ago.

**Fun fact:** Des Moines has an estimated population of 31,580. it is located approximately halfway between Seattle and Tacoma. In 1887 F.A. Blasher persuaded some friends in his home city of Des Moines, Iowa, to help finance the development of a town on Puget Sound. The work was done by the Des Moines Improvement Company. Lumber mills provided the community with its primary employment. Following WWII, suburbanization of the community occurred. With increased population, the county government was unable to supply the level of service and local control desired by Des Moines residents. In response to this, Des Moines was officially incorporated on June 17, 1959.

And of the people there, I really wasn’t surprised that at least 50% were selfish enough to not be wearing masks. 

What really got me though was that a good number of the non-mask crowd appeared to be tourists from other countries. A couple speaking mandarin and a group of 5 that were speaking German or Dutch are the ones that stood out to me. All without masks and on tour in the country with the least contained spread of a virus killing 1 person every 60 seconds (according to a report I read today). Seems...  not smart on their part.

Keep in mind that two days were included in the numbers reported yesterday making my count for yesterday's numbers an average across two days.

It is likely that a large number of negative results are being delayed in reporting since this spike in percent positive is out of the blue, and breaking previous records except for 12% on 7/4 which then saw a spike in negative results in the coming days.

The four new deaths is lower than the 14 yesterday.

Good news, as expected, we got a big update in overall tests, and they're mostly negative. Our % positivity rate is back down to the mid-low 3% range. Even some South KC cities are seeing improvement! For example, Kent is now down to 8.8% for it's 7-day avg % positivity, down from 10% a few weeks earlier. Hopefully this trend will continue!

As I was updating the numbers, I did notice I had to backfill a lot of earlier test numbers. Specifically, I had to update downwards, the number of total tests ... sometimes quite substantially (a few dozen or more). So you might notice that the % positivity rate might slightly higher going back a few weeks. But it's still good to see that we're trending down, regardless of these corrections. I wonder if a bunch of results that were previously added, were actually antibody results again. This is just my speculation though.

**Fun fact:** The Burke-Gilman Trail is a rail trail in King County, Washington. The 27-mile (43 km) multi-use recreational trail is part of the King County Regional Trail System and occupies an abandoned Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway corridor. The trail can trace its origins to the founding of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway on 15 April 1885, by ten men headed by judge Thomas Burke and Daniel Gilman. In its heyday, Burke and Gilman's road extended from Downtown north to Arlington and east to Rattlesnake Prairie above Snoqualmie Falls. Taken over by the Northern Pacific Railway around 1890, the line became part of the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970, and was abandoned in 1971.

CoronavirusWA,en334_0,King County (8/3) Charts per city,"Here are my charts for each city in King County. They are based on the data from [the King County daily COVID-19 outbreak summary](https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/data/daily-summary.aspx) as of 8/3/2020. In order to better compare city to city, I have calculated:

* The trailing 7-average, and
* scaled it to an average per 100k

This allows us to see how cities compare to each other and how they compare to the average for King County itself. 

All graphs and data are here: [Google Sheets link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16HXKTs5ZPGFnli3FRcTALsA40CovxCQoS-JF2GrETaY/edit?usp=sharing) (Thank you to this subreddit for suggestions and for u/JC_Rooks from whom I am borrowing the population counts). I hope to update this periodically and contribute to the ongoing case count posts though nowhere near the heroic rate of /u/secondsniglet and the team of contributers there.

Here are some excerpts from the spreadsheet

**King County**

&amp;#x200B;

[King County Average new cases per 100k and new case count](https://preview.redd.it/n3h1xxaf2xe51.png?width=1815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1040714e394afb0e11426e74edf44a275bd0133e)

**Seattle**

Seattle generally follows King County's graph (not surprising as u/JC_Rooks has taught us how big the city is), though in the second half of July, it appears that Seattle proper has be trending below average against King County overall.

https://preview.redd.it/hw9bhr184xe51.png?width=1793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=321ac0a6f0e9ef062cd9dfee6159a3de51cc5b72

**Which cities have been generally above average in July?**

Relatively speaking, we can see that some cities have always trended above the average count for King County.  Because of testing rates, it is not clear that we can compare early months to later ones. However, we can reasonably consider how often they are higher than the county average for that day. In these cities, it has been the majority of the pandemic, and for some, every day since April. Here are Auburn, Des Moines, Federal Way, Kent, Lakeland North, Lakeland South, SeaTac, Tukwila, and White Center.

**A few cities showed a high early peak in March/April and an encouraging steady below average rate against King County's average**

Enumclaw, Issaquah, Kenmore, Lake Forest Park, Lake Morton-Berrydale, Redmond, Shoreline, Snoqualmie. It would be reasonable to say that these cities adapted to an extreme case rate and have maintained good control of the virus (at least against the County average).

I hope this helps illuminate more about the city to city differences within a single county and look forward to incremental updates within the case count threads in the future.",1,1596518934,washington,2020-08-03 23:28:54

Here is the link - pdf warning: https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/FallGuidanceK-12.pdf

This is DOH guidance, not OSPI. If you are concerned about what your school is doing or not doing, I hope this can be a resource on what they *should* be doing.

Some highlights among many:

&gt;Wearing cloth **face coverings** may help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and is **required for staff and students in all public spaces**, except where specific exceptions are made based on age, development, or disability. 

...

&gt;People [staff or students] who are ill and had known exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19 should be encouraged to be tested for COVID-19 and should **stay out of school until at least 10 days after symptom onset**, and at least 24 hours after fever has resolved and symptoms have improved. (People with severe disease or immunocompromised may need to be isolated at home for longer.)

...

&gt;If a person believes they have had **close contact** to someone with COVID-19, but they are not sick ... they should not go to work, child care, school, or public places for **14** days

...

&gt;**COVID-19 outbreaks in school**

&gt;Definition: **Two or more laboratory-confirmed† COVID-19 cases among students or staff with onsets‡ within a 14-day period**, who are epidemiologically linked§, do not share a household, and were not identified as close contacts†† of each other in another setting during standard case investigation or contact tracing. 

&gt;If the school is grouping or cohorting students: Dismiss the **entire classroom** for home quarantine for 14 days if **two or more** confirmed cases of COVID-19 occur within the group or cohort within a 14 day period.

&gt;Close a school and **switch to remote learning for 14 days when**:

&gt;* 2 or more classrooms are dismissed due to outbreaks (in schools with 10 or fewer classrooms)
&gt;* &gt;=10% of classrooms are dismissed due to outbreaks (in schools with &gt; 10 classrooms)
&gt;* School cannot function due to insufficient teaching or support staff.",1,1596751148,washington,2020-08-06 15:59:08

Here is my opinion:
• it would be difficult for politicians to convince all medical experts and governors of states to go along with “faking” these guidelines just for the polls.
• people still go to vote regardless, mainly because they don’t care about the safety aspect of these mandates... aka people who are against the mask.
• I don’t believe Trump would be able to set up such an elaborate plan.

I know this is the internet, but please don’t bash me or my dad for any opinions we have! I’d appreciate if this discussion could be as civil and informative as possible!

CoronavirusWI,Username62415,The argument for opening schools is insincere and dishonest,"The political pundits going on about how schools need to reopen so that disadvantaged kids don’t fall further behind are just trying to sound reasonable and empathetic while they insist that we keep the economy running as usual, exponential growth of cases be damned. I find it hard to believe that they care about education at all. 

Wisconsin is a COVID hot spot right now, even considering in-person school starting up next month is irresponsible and considering the long term social and economic damage that a prolonged spike in infections would cause, I just can’t understand the rush to reopen, even from a strictly business point of view.

Here’s my take: I just taught online summer school, and the kids who did well in school also did well online. The kids who didn’t do well in school also didn’t do well online. Assignments are just as mediocre and uninteresting as they were in person. We use smartboards and Chromebooks in the classroom, so using Slides presented over Zoom for kids to watch on their Chromebooks is hardly a big difference.

Furthermore, Milwaukee County has the highest number of cases. It also has the highest concentration of black and Hispanic people in Wisconsin. And the highest risk racial groups for COVID are black and Hispanic people, especially those in lower income brackets with limited access to healthcare. And low income black and Hispanic kids are disproportionately more likely to attend schools that don’t have expensive amenities like updated HVAC systems, no-touch sinks &amp; soap dispensers, spacious classrooms, or even functional windows. These already underfunded schools will not be able to provide extra janitorial staff, extra cleaning supplies, appropriate masks for students who need them, plexiglass dividers, new HEPA filters and air purifiers, and additional space for social distancing. Low income parents are also less likely to want to send their kids back to school, and with good reason: they love their families and don’t want them to get sick or die, and they know that schools are not ready to make the changes needed for safety. They know this because schools were already struggling to give their kids an equitable experience *before* COVID.

There was a time to really care about educational equity and the overall quality of education in general, and that time was before our country became the epicenter of a pandemic.  Attending school wasn’t worth dying for last year and that’s still true today. People are just trying to stay alive and healthy, so fractions and book reports can either be learned online or they can wait. Education is just going to have to stay on the back burner for a while longer.",1,1594702832,wisconsin,2020-07-13 23:00:32

(*On Android, it would automatically prompt to add it as a shortcut to your home screen and on apple you can follow [these](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/add-a-web-link-to-home-screen-iphone-ipad/) instructions*)

2. **WI State Data** - Soured from WI DHS. They have exposed API's for the all data shown on this app. It shows the daily positive increase along with hospitalizations and death.

3. **WI County Data** - You can select the county from the dropdown and it will show you data for each county. 

4. **WI Positive Cases** - Age Graph &amp; testing graph: I just added this as I was curious to see this data. 

I am using WI DHS data which they have exposed via API's. I believe i am not breaking any of their rules as specified [here](https://data.dhsgis.wi.gov/pages/gis-data-disclaimer). 

I havent got a chance to test it out completely. Let me know if you see any issues or want to add any functionality. I can look into those when I get some free time.

CoronavirusWI,covid_IT,"We have fewer tests, and some are less accurate. Advice inside.","Hospital worker here. I do not have a medical background but I enjoy learning and want to share a few bits of recent news and advice. 

I haven’t gotten in trouble for posting here yet, so let’s do it again! [Verification](https://imgur.com/a/85Fumt1). (If you recognize me or my employer please don’t post that.)


**TLDR:** WI hospitals are getting fewer test kits from the federal government and some of those test kits are lower quality. This is not the fault of the state or the hospital system. Hospitals are doing the best they can and you should continue to get normal care and consult your doctor with concerns.


Some people doubt who I am or my sources, so I’ll try to provide those. I’m pasting text from a hospital email instead of screenshots - we all know that I could just make a fake email and screenshot that if I really wanted to be a jerk. Just trust me here.


An internal email on Wednesday to all staff read: “As the federal government redirects testing supplies to COVID-19 hot spots across the U.S., we are called to update our testing approach.”
We’re receiving 50% fewer test kits. I don’t know if it’s 50% less of *all* types, or just the community testing type. But there are a lot fewer test kits to go around now because they’re being sent to other states.


The email continued: “In Wisconsin, we will get a weekly allocation of Exact Sciences test kits through the state so our community testing efforts will continue. More information will be forthcoming as we work through the details.” These give results in less than 48 hours.


Naturally, the first thing I did was google Exact Sciences, and [their own website says their test is pretty low-quality](https://www.exactlabs.com/covid-19-testing). “Validation studies showed that the Exact Sciences Laboratories test had 95% agreement with positive results and 100% agreement with negative results”. So there’s a 5% false negative rate. 1 in 20 patients with covid will be told they’re clear. This is pretty bad.


The two other types of tests that our hospital system uses are the CDC PCR test and the Cepheid rapid test. Both of those have higher than 99% sensitivity and specificity. They’re great! But our hospital only gets 20 Cepheid tests per day (I asked). If we had enough reagents we could complete hundreds of high-quality tests every day with results in less than an hour. 


The CDC PCR test is highly accurate but involves shipping the swab elsewhere to be tested. Recent result times at my hospital were 3 days, but 3-7 days is the range they tell patients.


**Piece of advice:** our drive-through testing locations still use the CDC PCR test. That’s great, that’s the test you want. Our Urgent Care locations use the Exact Sciences test, which is not ideal. If you’re about to take a covid-19 test, it’s worth the phone call to see which test your locations offer. If you can get the CDC test, or a similar test with high accuracy, do that one.

 
I’m sure other hospitals are in the same boat – just trying to do the best with the limited supplies we have. I have immense respect for the doctors, nurses, lab techs, and leaders in healthcare. I'm not trying to make my own company look bad or good here, I just want to share these facts so you, my fellow Wisconsinites, can make better-informed decisions.

Granted there are legit (and rare) reasons why a person can't wear a mask but let's put that aside for  a moment.   I am happy to support any business that has a policy that masks ARE REQUIRED and if one can't wear one, alternatives are available (they shop for you, they can do curbside, etc.) but you will NOT enter the store without one.  Full stop.

I understand your position and respect your views.  The issue is not about the wearing of a mask; it is the government mandate and the illegal action taken by the Governor.  We can’t allow a virus to destroy the rule of law and the constitutional principles meant to protect citizens even in the worst of times.

For weeks, the contacts to my office have been running heavily against a face mask mandate.  Since Evers announced the order, the calls and emails to my office today are overwhelmingly opposed to a government mandate.  The anger at his order is unbelievable.

I will follow the wishes of a majority of my constituents and work to block it.  I have no issue with individuals deciding for themselves whether to wear masks or not.  I also support the right of businesses to establish mask policies on their private properties as they see fit.  However, I oppose government overreach and infringements of constitutional principles.

Two articles from this week cover why public health officials won’t be requiring masks in Sweden and the Netherlands.  In the case of the Dutch, they conducted an extensive review of the research and determined that masks were ineffective in slowing the spread of Covid-19.  In Sweden, a country with the least government regulations regarding Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic: now in July has plummeting case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths.  Public health officials in Sweden also deemed that mandating masks would be infective and unnecessary in fighting Covid-19.


https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-netherlands/dutch-government-will-not-advise-public-to-wear-masks-minister-idUSKCN24U2UJ


https://fortune.com/2020/07/29/no-point-in-wearing-mask-sweden-covid/?fbclid=IwAR3N2BZALLAWN-YI6hrrCXeD6TpMyAfxVH3N07A_oRkcD1GMsalCgSMLADg

I would also note that the World Health Organization’s (WHO) official stance on masks is to only recommend use in circumstances when social distancing is not possible.  The scientists at the WHO have resisted, so far, calling for mask mandates because the research on the effectiveness of masks in stopping or slowing the spread of Covid-19 is still inconclusive.

California has had some form of mask mandates in place for about six-weeks and state officials have admitted it has shown no effect in lowering rates of infection.  Those state officials also noted there was growing evidence of mask fatigue among citizens leading to increasing numbers of people no longer wearing masks.


In Wisconsin, there are already numerous Sheriffs, police chiefs and District Attorneys saying they won’t enforce the order since it is legally questionable.  We need to continue to use education and reasonable policies of encouragement to achieve desired actions by the public.  Historically, government mandates that start with widespread opposition often fail to achieve the public policy goal envisioned.

CoronavirusWI,notyetfreeone,Employer advice,"I work for a busy dental(non emergency)office in Madison and need some advice. My employer use to tell staff if a pt(patient)was infected with covid as well as staff, but wouldn't say who so we would not know if we were potentially exposed. If one of the doctors saw a pt who tested positive they would simply say they didn't see them for more than 15 minutes so they were never exposed. We were sent emails with instructions of how to communicate with pts. which was to more or less state that someone has been in our office had tested positive. It was very vague and misleading basically avoiding any information that staff had tested positive and may have worked on them or their son or daughter. 

We had 4 co workers test positive and one doctor within a week. They since have stopped telling us if anyone tests positive. The most recent staff member was confirmed and we were not told. That is the last that we know of at least.

Also, a co worker was recently let go after she told our business manager that it was wrong to not tell us if we were possibly exposed. She was sent an email stating that this is an ""at will"" employment office. They have permission to let anyone go at any time and for no reason at all.

Obviously I can't speak up or disclose any information out of fear of retaliation. 

I'm hoping for some guidance, input or advice if anything can be done.

CoronavirusWI,Enviralmental,"If not masks, then what do you propose we do?","Studies have shown that throwing information at anti-vaxers doesn't work, so I'm trying a new tactic with those that oppose wearing masks. Let me know if you think this could work:

1. First, understand where they are coming from. No one wants to wear a mask. No one wants to be forced to stay home. But no one wants to die (obviously these are arguable to some extent, but most people would agree.) 
2. What we're currently doing isn't working. Cases are rising. (also debatable to some, but where we had none there are some)
3. If not masks, then what? I've not seen any other proposals to help fight this besides what we're currently doing, which based on #2 above isn't working. 

It's easy to say that x or y isn't the answer, but it's much harder to come up with a solution. 

I've already reached out to Nass and Fitz with this pleading with them to not fight the mandate (despite how toothless it is). For what it's worth, someone posted Nass' response which was similar to what I received. My first two emails were responded too, but not the third where I asked 'if not this, then what?'

If you think this could work, please reach out to those in power and tell them what you think. I'm not Nass' constituent, but he's impacting activities in my state which does concern me. Therefore I should have a voice and you do too.",1,1596558450,wisconsin,2020-08-04 10:27:30
