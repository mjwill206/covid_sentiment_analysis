CoronavirusAlabama,Capta1nKrunch,Eviction scummery.,"My girlfriend and I moved into a new apartment at the very end up April, right before things got bad.  


She is immuno compromised, her doctor ordered her to quarantine almost immediately, and didn't work for 2 months leaving me to be the only one working to keep us afloat and pay all of the other bills. Talk about horrible timing with the pandemic and all.

I was able to get the first rent payment in but things quickly started stacking up. My girlfriend started a new job, she worked something out with the office manager where we could pay a couple of hundred dollars a week until we're caught up (her and I get paid on alternating weeks, I had bi-weekly pay schedules), then today while I'm at work I get a call from my girlfriend.

She tells me the office manager called her saying their agreement is no long valid, things change ""day to day"", and the landlord is demanding over $1000 by Friday or we're getting evicted.  


Go fuck yourself is what I want to tell him but I really don't want to end up with my parents until we could afford to go into something else.",1,1594676049,alabama,2020-07-13 17:34:09

We (researchers from the University of the Fraser Valley, BC, Canada) are looking for individuals (19+ years of age) who have had COVID-19 and are of ***any*** fitness level to complete an online survey. The online survey consist of 3 parts: demographic variables, COVID-19 symptoms, and physical activity/fitness levels prior to being infected. The survey takes about 7-9 minutes to complete (average time = 6 minutes).

The aim of our study is to learn if physical activity levels have any influence on the number of symptoms, durations and severity of symptoms, as well as any complications associated with having COVID-19.

Needless to say they have moved on.  We are focusing in her bright future.  She starts college soon and that’s our new priority.  Here’s the problem..... a bunch of “Karen’s” out there felt that it was a crime that their kids did not get a graduation, after the school announced canceling the one planned this week, due to Covid.  They just couldn’t take no for an answer!   So they took it upon themselves to plan one on their own at a nearby venue near the school this week!  First off, I wanna know what place agreed to hold this mass gathering (I actually know what venue it is, they must not of gotten the memo prohibiting any groups over 50).  This event, which is going to be at a bare minimum 500 kids plus parents...
My question is, will the local law-enforcement shut this down?   Will this venue be cited?  Will these moms, that decided to come up with this f#%ked up idea be cited as well?!  I’m baffled!  I’m actually really mad now that if they go ahead with this and there are some kids that will not be going (because their parents won’t let them and it’s against the law) so they’ll be missing out on the graduation!   it’s just a joke!

CoronavirusAZ,pushing-up-daisies,The bar exam and coronavirus: a dark comedy coming to a city near you!,"I feel bad for complaining about this, but I just need to vent. I want to apologize up front if any of this comes across tone deaf or whiney. I know people are struggling with much bigger problems. 

I graduated law school this year and I’m taking the bar exam this month. Studying for this massively important test during a pandemic has been a nightmare. I’m very fortunate that I haven’t been personally affected by the virus, but classmates have had family members die or gotten sick themselves. But studying during all this is just one struggle. 

My biggest concern is taking the exam itself. Normally, the exam is at the Phoenix Convention Center, and all 500-600 applicants sit in one giant room. The test is a 2 day test, six hours each day. With every single person hyperventilating the entire time because their entire future that they’ve been working toward for three years of law school rides on these two days. (Mostly kidding about the hyperventilating). 

Of course, the convention center is closed, but the Supreme Court is determined for the bar to take place and is finding another location. So far, the only guidance we’ve been given is that everyone will be required to wear a face shield or mask. Every applicant will be seated at their own six foot table. Every applicant must swear under oath they have not tested positive for COVID, not experienced symptoms of COVID, and not had close contact with anyone (to their knowledge) with COVID in the two weeks before the exam. Every applicant will have their temperature taken going into the exam, and I would imagine after breaks as well. If the applicant has a fever, they will not be allowed to take the exam. What alternatives are there is you are refused entry to the exam? No idea. 

Today the Arizona Supreme Court announced that they will hold an online bar in October for applicants who do not want to take the July bar, but the score you receive is only valid in Arizona and will not transfer to other states (something a lot of applicants need).

So cool, all these test takers have this choice: take the July bar and put your health at risk, and possibly become a vector for transmission after the exam, or postpone the test until October, where you can take an exam that doesn’t transfer, or February, when there is another national exam. 

Why not just postpone then? MOST job offers require taking and passing the first available bar. I don’t see most firms requiring their incoming associate attorneys to take this exam, but they definitely will not pay them at an attorney salary until they take and pass that exam. Most of us are getting paid a law clerk salary until then. I’m grateful to be working, but when student loans come due in November, I don’t know how I’ll manage. My own personal constraint is that I work for a very small firm, and the success of the firm requires a second attorney to handle the caseload. Delaying the exam directly affects my boss and his family, and the quality of service we can give clients. A lot of applicants aren’t the young law grad you would expect. A significant portion of my graduating class was over 30 and married with children. They have to support their families. It’s really not as simple as just waiting for another test. 

Sure, even though we aren’t all 25 year olds, most applicants are not in a high risk group. Other than those immunocompromised, or those who are caretakers for high risk groups, or those who have clients in high risk groups (you’d be shocked how many people in high risk groups refuse zoom appointments or teleconferences). But you know what, some of us just *don’t* want to get the virus. It’s a long recovery time. There possibly permanent damage to your lungs even if you have very mild symptoms. 

Some states have decided to give this class admission to the bar based just on graduating law school, completely cancelling the bar. This has received some criticism, but realistically, it’s the only safe approach to this problem. The bar exam doesn’t measure success or knowledge, it’s a “minimum competency exam.” It literally just makes sure you know enough not to royally screw up. And there’s a lot of evidence that it really fails to even do that, like all the attorneys that are disciplined for failing to represent their clients competently every year. So idk, maybe make an exception ONE time in light of this insane fucking pandemic going on. 

I’m grateful to be working right now. I’m so fortunate to be employed and have a good career coming up. I put myself through school, so I 100% appreciate all the opportunities I have. But I am just so terrified of getting sick before the exam, or because of the exam, and then transmitting the virus to my friends and family and coworkers and clients after the exam. So much of this world is in chaos and I just feel like I can’t get control of anything. Ugh.",1,1593649315,arizona,2020-07-01 20:21:55

CoronavirusAZ,yeethavocbruh,Confession,"
I want to start out this and say I’m sorry. I’m sorry doesn’t do enough. I’m sorry doesn’t bring family members back from the grave. But I’m sincerely sorry. 

I do marketing for retail and restaurants. I have been keeping track of COVID-19 since January. I have told my friends, coworkers, and family to be careful since the beginning. I have been told that I’m “fear-mongering” and being “dramatic” since the beginning. But here I am, still marketing for retail and restaurants. 

This is where the confession comes through. I’m sorry. I’m sorry that I’ve been marketing for retail even when we were in lockdown. I’m sorry I was marketing for when restaurants, salons, and nail shops began to open up and I said it was ok to dine-in and be pampered. I didn’t want to. My company said I had to. I had to put those messages out there. I’m sorry I put my own personal profit over lives. 

I feel awful that I’ve been telling people to shop and dine. I don’t want to. But I’ve been told that I have to. 

I want to quit my job more than anything because I hate the fact that I’m contributing to the spread of COVID-19. But if I quit than I’d be out of a job and I know very well that the government will not help me pay my bills. But at the end of the day, my job means nothing compared to the lives that have been lost due to my marketing. 

I do not know what to do. Everyday for months I’ve considered leaving my job. I try my hardest to focus on curbside pickup and to-go orders. But my coworkers tell me that I need to do more to bring people in. I’m stuck and I know I’m contributing to the rising cases.",1,1593670736,arizona,2020-07-02 02:18:56

CoronavirusAZ,opiniohated_asshole,National testing supply is being constrained,"Nationally states are starting to receive less and less tests.  It’s important to remember that this means the case count WILL go down, and the % positive will most likely trend up, as more tests will be being applied to likely cases as opposed to the general population of “unknowns”.   

Next things to see, would be follow the total tests per WEEK metric to observe these shortages.   


Be cautious of political attempts to use case count lowering to justify any type of action.   

What will or would be a good sign is if % positive went down, and ICU usage went down. 



We also should also be careful of monitoring bed stats and hospital admittance as people may be turned away.        


These constraints are not due to our gov.   It’s a supply chain issue.  Remember data evolves, we can’t always use the same graph / source / equation we did previously to learn the same information.    This is a key fact many people miss.   We must evolve where we look for answers based on the outside factors that can taint results.

CoronavirusAZ,AdrennaTheGamer,Workplace Safety,"So, I have a concern and was wondering if anyone had any advice for me. I won't name where I work but its a resort and they are fighting the order to close down the two pools we have and the cafe bar. One of the managers I heard was trying to fight back on the order because he doesn't believe the virus is real.. 

We are not getting hazard pay and of course guests are not wearing masks. They have a 50 person limit BUT no one has been regulating it. They have been packed for the last few weeks. Our occupancy has shot up and we have been busier then usual with everyone pretending the virus is gone..

I kinda need my job as there are bills I still need to pay but I feel like its almost not worth working there because obviously the managers seem to care about making money then making sure guests are safe. Is there anything I can do? Like if I quit because of them refusing to close down the pools and bar would I still be able to get unemployment? Our pools and bar are huge. There have been like an easy 120+ people at them daily.

I feel like I am putting my life at risk and my family's lives at risk too. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated. Stay safe!",1,1593713291,arizona,2020-07-02 14:08:11

Staff need to be in full PPE all the time, have all residents dining in their own rooms, residents who see each other need to wear masks, isolate and test everyone at the first sign of illness, and staff need to be banned from working in multiple homes. Test all residents and staff regularly, and staff need a good sick leave policy so they can be encouraged to stay home if they don't feel well.

CoronavirusAZ,jellojohnson,Whole family was hit with Covid last month. It took my Mom on June 26th and my Unlce may not last much longer.,"Last month in early June we all started showing symptoms right after a camping trip to the lake. We tried to socially distance and keep to ourselves but somehow we got it. I knew something was wrong when my wife started to have a cough 2 days after getting home with me and my mom following shortly after. Then the fever hit us all and I knew what it was.  My Mom's doctors told her it was probably a sinus infection, but I knew better and told her to get a test asap. Everyone came back positive and we were all having symptoms and quarintined at that point. So on day 5 my Mom started to have a lot of trouble breathing and since she had asthma and lupus we took her to the ER. Her oxygen levels were dangerously low and she was becoming increasingly weak and fatigued. They intubated her that night. The next 2 days my Uncle also got admitted for similar symptoms. Meanwhile the rest of us in the family had a week of coughing, fevers and body pain. My Mom's and Uncle's condition bounced back and forth for a few days and it even looked like she might recover at one point however a secondary MRSA infection developed in her lungs and at that point it was just all down hill. She passed on June 26th while the rest of us were in our last days of recovery. My Uncle's condition worsened and they had to put him on dialysis as his kidneys were only functioning at 15%. He also developed double pneumonia. At this point he is barley hanging on and may pass any day now as well. The rest of us are mostly recovered now but we still have residual issues. So Covid basically destroyed 1/5 of my family this year. We are all still in shock from it all but trying to piece ourselves back together...

I've only been ""here"" on reddit for the past month or so, and I have some questions about the dashboard I was hoping you might know the answers to. I'm sorry if these seem dumb.

1) The numbers now include surge beds, but they didn't originally, right?

2) Do hospitalization discharges include deaths? And does anyone have a graph superimposing the discharges against the hospitalizations? Because since the y axis increments change, it's very misleading, the discharges are much less then the hospitalizations. 

3) Are ""ICU beds"" part of ""covid-19 inpatients""?

4) WHY IS OVER 60% of the hospitalization status of cases unknown??? Is it because they're not keeping track of cases/ following up with them, and just relying on hospital reported data?

5) Is there any place that breaks down the age 20-44 group in something like 20-30 and 30-44? It irritates me that they have a 24-year spread for one of the demographic groups....",3,1593972107,arizona,2020-07-05 14:01:47

CoronavirusAZ,throwaway_869975468,Concerned about unsafe business practices involving covid19 at my job,"Disclaimer: throw away for obvious reasons. Please do not ask me where I work, I won't reveal that information. If my information is released, I could possibly lose my job. Also, please disregard any grammar or typos, I am on mobile.

I've worked for the same company for 20 years. The company is full of nepotism, and they have the mentality of "" do as I say, not as I do "". If I went to HR about my concerns, I would fear of some sort of retaliation or termination. Therefore I am posting here as to what I should do. As a result of the unsafe business practices involving covid-19, I am concerned about contracting the contagion from work. I'm not the only one. Several other employees at my location and other locations have the same fears.

For example, approximately a month ago a fellow employee called in sick. A few days later, this employee contacted another employee and alerted them that their spouse was in the hospital and positive with covid-19. At the time, this employee was not displaying symptoms. This employee told the other employee to alert everyone in the department they worked in, in good faith. This employee knew our HR department would not be releasing any information concerning our possible exposure to covid19. HR stated releasing any information about this employee was a violation of the HIPAA law. Furthermore, HR was allowing this employee to return to work, as long as they were not displaying symptoms, and consistently wearing a mask at work. They claimed this was part of CDC guidelines, which they were following. I looked it up, and at the time, this is what the CDC recommend. This employee refused to return to work. Within 2 weeks, this employee fell ill with covid-19. 

The company I work for claims they follow CDC guidelines concerning covid-19. The CDC states it is important for businesses to alert other employees about a possible exposure to the virus. However the corporation I work for isn't doing that. They're keeping everything quiet.

Most recently an employee had a spouse that was ill. They suspected the virus. HR was allowing this person to work, as long as they wore a mask ans because they weren't displaying symptoms. At this time masks had already been mandated in our company. This employee did not want to work and risk exposing the rest of the other employees. The next day this employee came in, and was sent home, due to cold-like symptoms. The spouse of this employee received positive test results, about a week later the employee received a positive test result. Currently half the staff in this employee was associated with is out, either with positive test results, or awaiting test results, or they're too afraid to come to work.

Furthermore, I know of other employees who have been possibly a exposed. The employees can't take off work because they won't be paid. They haven't tested positive and they don't have symptoms. So they're just working. I know I'm exposed repeatedly, all day, every day.

Management has not told us any of this information. We receive our information directly from the affected employee. Management is extremely secretive about anyone who has been exposed to covid19, or has a positive test result.

They have not shut down the establishment to disinfect. They did disinfect overnight once. 

What do I do? This is so immoral! I feel like if more people knew about this they would be outraged!",5,1593988974,arizona,2020-07-05 18:42:54

CoronavirusAZ,Nynydancer,Went to ER last night for a 15 years VERY healthy athletic girl with chest pains,"My daughter is an incredibly fit 15 year old. She trains full time in ballet. Now she can barely walk from toilet to bed without bad chest pains.  There are no preexisting conditions. 

She started with symptoms on Wednesday with a sore throat, earache and headache. By Friday, she had chest pains. Last night, Sunday, I had to take her to ER because the pains were getting worse and her breathing was poor. 

We do not have covid tests yet, but the doctor told me on Friday we all almost certainly have it and to act as if we do. He also said even if her test is negative, not to believe it as there is a 30% failure rate on tests. 

In ER, they xrayed her chest and found the fuzzy stuff you see in covid patients and put her on a heavy duty antibiotic. She doesn’t have pneumonia yet. They let us go home a few hours later with instructions on what to watch for. 

The doc said covid 19 is spreading like crazy but the kids she sees have made it okay. 

So yes this has upended our lives pretty much. My kid is miserable. We are all on quarantine, and I am scared shitless. 

We have been verrry careful. I consider myself informed. The one risky thing we did was send my two teens to ballet believing the precautions they were taking were enough. (Studio is still open btw). I am not saying for sure she got it there either, because she has not been there as often as her sibling lately. Who knows really.  Aside from ballet we have been hermits, just the rare pick up of take out or getting gas or dr. 

We aren’t are statistic, or a hospitalization or god forbid worse. But this sickness sucks and it will be a recovery that won’t take a week or a just a few days.

My kid is the last kid I would’ve expected to get this and one sick kid out of so many might be an acceptable risk for some people. But just to share, it CAN happen to your kid even if they are very healthy.",38,1594053663,arizona,2020-07-06 12:41:03

Dr. Birx showed a slide that seemed to indicate that things are looking up. Screenshot here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0zqylxduzdn26e/Screenshot%202020-07-08%2009.11.11.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0zqylxduzdn26e/Screenshot%202020-07-08%2009.11.11.png?dl=0)

She said ""the 7 day average is showing flattening"", and as to the bottom chart, that the red line indicates ""ER visits for any of the COVID-like symptoms"", which seems to look promising.

Are things looking promising? Am I missing something?

It's really hard to know how to feel about this overall. On the one hand, you don't necessarily want to overreact. But not he other hand, you don't want to dismiss anything.

CoronavirusAZ,tquinn35,Maricopa County 7-Day Avg vs State AVG Calculated Using Day Tests Were Preformed,"I have recently been commenting on how the 7-day AVG that is presented in many places is not a great metric since its includes tests from the past and with Arizona reporting around 50% of tests from more then 7 days ago didn't seem like a very sound metric. So I decided to calculate it for the day they test was performed.  What I found was rather disturbing and I admit I was partially wrong. Maricopa county only reports numbers up till June 30th as of now and up to that point Maricopa County has a 7 day case average of 635 cases per million people which is over a 100 more cases per million then New York's Peak. The state as a whole up to the 30th is reporting a 7 day average 537 per million which is slightly higher then New York's.

CoronavirusAZ,skitch23,Nearly 100k tests have yet to be analyzed. We are not flattening our curve.,"In an effort to poke holes in VP Pence &amp; Gov Ducey's claim that we are flattening our curve, I went back thru my data to calculate the number of administered tests yet to be analyzed. Our daily reported cases are flattening , but we have *doubled* our tests in the queue over the past two weeks. 

Not considering ramping up testing, this is a snap shot of what it looks like right now:

- ~98,078 total tests (PCR &amp; Serology combined) still needing to be analyzed (on June 26 we would have been around 49,575)
- ~21,596 positive cases yet to be reported (at 22% positive rate)
- ~390 future deaths if we hold at what I think is a low 1.8% death rate
- ~86,438 PCR tests still needing to be analyzed 

I wish the news would run a story on this. /u/arizonarepublic any help??? 

Methods: I used 7 day increments so the data would not be skewed by an inconsistent number of weekend days. I took the average of the highest four weekdays of the prior week and then multiplied by 5 to get a full weekdays worth of tests. I added that to the prior week's Saturday &amp; Sunday's number of tests. Then I subtracted the current week's processed tests. The delta is the approximate number of tests waiting to be analyzed. % positive was calculated by averaging 7-day average of the % positive cases from 6-10 days ago which seems to be the most stable point as far as testing goes. 1.8% death rate per AZDHS (2,038 deaths out of 112,671 cases).

CoronavirusAZ,opiniohated_asshole,About today conference from your Friendly neighborhood Healthcare Data Analyst,"My last post really had some good reception with a few people being very thankful for it.   I want to keep this one short, and to the point.   We all recognize people are skilled in different fields, and that we are not.   First let's all recognize we are not state legislators, we are not economists, we are not data analysts.    (Unless you are)   First lets look inward and examine what we DON""T KNOW at an expert level.  Understanding something at a basic level, while on the internet makes us damn near an expert in real life is still just a basic level.  





I have worked with state governments outlining strategy for healthcare stuff in the past for declarations of emergency and such, I have tried to move the same wheels we need moving now.  I am a professional in data analytics.   I can't stand how Gov. Ducey handled this from the get go.  I have written many very long letters with included professional level data analytics and recommendations to various members of our community , government, and media for the last 4 months now.      I am also a business owner and support a full shelter in place order (as a resident as arizona and as a data analyst).




That being said,

I unlike many of you, have had to talk to people in power about these very same type of topics on conference calls.  (Like the governor's call ducey references)  I am in positions like that frequently, where I'm trying to explain to a group of high power national individuals why they are being stupid with peoples lifes begging them to take the very smallest action possible to be on the right path.  



I've watched what ""needed"" to be done get ignored constantly for profits, stupidity, pride, what ever.  This is my career.    I want to point out that today, I was relieved in today's conference.    




now before you get enraged, I won't even spellcheck, I'll just keep typing.   Yes I agree its not enough, Yes I agree we have a ton a questions, Yes he dodged questions YES YES YES.   FINE.  YES.     2 weeks ago when he spoke, he seemed afraid.  (To explain to you in my professional experience, last week was similar to when I advice people their options are A B C etc and they go with D.  30 days later, every state / county / region that did follow my advice is showing a measurable rate of improvement, and they are worse.  On that review call, the stakeholder/decision maker will outline their numbers with the same demeanor and type of presentation that Ducey had on the 29th.   They were wrong, they took their licks,   people above them (corporation wise, or expert wise) have put them in place, but not only that, they have proven to them that they were wrong.  The person feels bad, and is grasping at straws to save their own self worth/image / esteem etc.     The people I work with lead ""teams/constituencies"" of sometimes hundred of thousands of workers, they still need to appear a leader.  



That was the 29th.      Today he had a fire in him that I love seeing at work.   I hope you are still reading, because I typed all of this to give you all hope.  This is what I do at work, I wait for influential ""dumb asses"" to finally swallow their pride , and not just do what I say (how is that any better than them making wrong choices based on their own dumb logic)  but that they understood at a basic level the Data, the numbers, the science, the logic, the variables what ever .  They weighed the options I gave them correctly, and changed their course.   Professional when someone adapts to my idea finally, I switch sides and start trying to convince them to not do it.    It's not my job to determine strategy that could impact millions of people.  It's my job to make sure the people who DO,  are damn sure of what they are doing and why.   After a decision is made by someone I'm working with, 2 months, 2 years later, when somebody goes ""did you consider that your choice could lead to &lt;INSERT TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED HERE&gt;  the answer is almost always yes, we weighed that and considered it.  I'm a professional devils advocate basically.   




Today in my opinion Gov. D.     Has came around.   He isn't make the decisions we want,  that's the gig.  It's why I've spent a good part of my adult life avoiding public eye and working behind the scenes with very visible people.    He has to make decisions and face our wrath and scruteny weighing options.  I finally believe he is looking at the right graphs, surrounding himself with some good advisers, caring about the right factors.  Not as much as I want, but he is starting.   




He spoke with a passion and fire today, that was not pandering, not trying to impress people, but screw you tone frequently.   He was no longer trying to ""sell us"" (except for 1 part from my opinion).      He stopped talking about the reopening date, the biggest one is his talk about a state mask mandate.  HE IS RIGHT.   It seemed like a question dodge but it was slightly different from the last time.   He said that he's working with local , because a state wide mandate does nothing if the PEOPLE don't care.  Look at eagar, look at pinal,  a state mandate will change nothing.  How many gyms stayed open.    Our government is set up with very strong abilities for loop holes we all know that.  He needs to make sure he doesn't lose the appearance of power.  If he mandates masks, and a county defies it, it makes it worse.    He is right 100%  HE NEEDS to educate the people, so they all want it.   The people who would listen to a state order mask policy are already doing it.  We have to re-educate the people that the covidiots listen too, I've spent the last 4 months working on that, not for all of you but for my at risk family stuck in Arizona trapped in their house.    




He left everything way more open ended negative, yes this meeting didn't talk about much, but the tone has shifted the last 3 press conferences watch them back to back to see what I mean.    This one left us ready for more restrictions in the next meeting.   My favorite part of the meeting is when a reporter kept asking him  (politely) about the next 2 weeks , and ducey answered we have more options quickly and dismissively.    Realistically we could see a shelter in place order tomorrow, or never, but just because we are not doing something today, doesn't mean we are waiting two weeks to analyze things.  




In my area, I start work about 4-5 hours before the big wigs show up to work.  I pull new data, build dashboards,  plug it into historical charts, i find variances and oddities i dig into them, I find variables that contribute to them, I build new reports historical evaluating those variables to see if I can find correlation, I make predictions math them out, all kinds of junk.  Then those people show up, and I have an initial meeting to present them todays region/area wide numbers right when they come in,  2 hours or so (once I've had my Lunch (chicken wings buffalo at 8am has somehow become OK in my life)) we will have an industry / business wide / national / meeting with all the little areas  we move on to the industry/national/complete view.     

many of you will recognize this in AZ from this subreddit when cases were going down national and everyone said that's because new york is improved.  YES!  that is what I do at work.  Finding out how even numbers staying the same, tells us different things.   



Sometimes the press conference being the same, can tell us different things too.     I know many people may disagree and that is 100% ok.   I really think it's time to start trying to look for the good that's happening around arizona and be publicly thankful and polite in regard to THOSE CHANGES.   the definition of restaurant today is SOO much better than the definition of bar on June 29th.  Thank you DD.   Nice work.    



You don't want the Governor to stop listening to community voices  of residential or invested experts like me.  We are community voices the same as yours.   He is changing his approach, and is going the right direction.  We should try and show him that we see that, and help re educate those around us.   



Still hold people accountable for the factual things you disagree with, but do it politely and stop denying the positive.     Mental health is deteriorating, suicide is up, the strain on families, relationships, businesses is all huge.  We are all facing times at our worse and when better to define what type of people we want to be?    



I am thankful for the messages put forward today, I wish we had taken more drastic steps but I am very thankful for the messages and statements point forward.  I hope that if the communities do still not respond in kind with our numbers, that Governor Ducey has the courage to stand by his words and not caving to media or politics.   Let our schools stay closed until it is safe, before our winter visitors get here.    I hope that masks continue to be a forefront discussion and that we can see publicly the steps governor ducey is taking to convince the counties to work with each other when they share common borers.    I hope we as a community can start pulling together to bring awareness to the good steps as well as the bad.   I hope people stop trying to pretend they are experts when they are not, like it appears Governor Ducey is now doing.   




Please guys, I'm just a person like you.  I am very good at my job in this field and have been recognized by various industry leaders.   If you are unsure, and scared because you know the facebook and twitter comments are insane and terrible and you are overwhelmed and don't know what to think please believe in hope.   If you don't want to use my hope by proxy please reach out, not with panic or fear, but let's talk real.    PM me, I will help you as much as I can.  Just remember anger and fear are the two easiest things to find right now, we don't need to be fearful of the wrong things.  

Todays press conference gave me a little hope, and it should you too.



[For the record I am 100% in favor of an immediate shelter in place, and state wise mask mandate, and very strict clear cut enforceable punishments as well as school closures.]


also stop downvoting people you disagree with.  We can't change minds if we silence those trying to learn (respectfully)  as long as they are not being rude etc, upvote them for visibility so someone can maybe help them understand.   Reddits biggest problem is upvote = I agree downvote = I disagree.   Let's be better than that, and upvote based on quality or genuine questions, or people who need guidance instead of how we do it.",1,1594345438,arizona,2020-07-09 21:43:58

CoronavirusAZ,Odin_In_AZ,AN OPEN LETTER to Mr. Ducey.,"&gt;This message is for Doug Ducey and it is coming from an utterly frustrated Arizonan. 

&gt;Mr. Ducey, you are in denial if you think the polling showing you are worst ranked Governor in the country is a ""charicterization.""

&gt;It is the truth. In fact, the truth is far worse than that. The truth is that you do not have the confidence of the Arizonan people and we are disgusted by your inaction. 

&gt;We are embarrased to have you at the head of our state. We will never forget this, and we will never forgive you. 

&gt;I will not state the number of deaths that are on your head, because you know the number. 

&gt;In fact, the truth is that the number is much higher than is currently even reported and it continues to grow every day you do nothing. 

&gt;You stated yesterday that now is Arizona's time for ""maximum effort,"" yet you only reiterated an order already put into effect 10 days prior. 

&gt;Earlier in the year, you issued an executive order that closed the state down. THAT is maximum effort. NOT what you are doing now. 

&gt;If it really is time for maximum effort, then stand up Mr. Ducey. Stand up and ACTUALLY lead our state. DO the maximum effort. Close down AZ. 

&gt;A leader is someone who makes the tough decisions in order to save the lives of the CITIZENS, in spite of potential fallout from the president or businesses. 

&gt;If you cannot do that, you are completely and without a doubt unfit to be Governor of this state. 

&gt;Due to your actions up to this point, I can say with certainty that you will ALREADY be remembered as a stain on Arizona's history. Forever. 

&gt;However, if you don't step up and act as a true leader right now, you will forevermore be remembered the world around as a weak and cowardly traitor. 

&gt;Do the right thing, Mr. Ducey. The people of Arizona trusted you to always do right by THEM. It's time to finally make good on that promise. 

&gt;Signed, 
&gt;Odin_in_AZ

I do not have social media aside from this Reddit account. I called and was on hold with the Governor's office for about 30 minutes this morning, so I opted to just record the below as a voicemail message. I will attempt to call again later. 

I also emailed his office directly the below message. 

Feel free to email him the following, as well. Or attempt to call his office and leave this message. 

You also have my permission to spread this letter wherever you see fit. I am hoping that if it gets far enough around, he will hear it and have a change of heart.

CoronavirusAZ,jschreiber77,Coronavirus + Pandemic Relief Fund,"Greetings everyone,

I've started wondering what the United States would look like if we had been better prepared for a global pandemic (one in which we've never seen nor experienced before). I thought...what if the government creates a ""Pandemic Relief Fund"" for future pandemics (because as we all know, there will be another pandemic -- it's not an if...it's a when).

If the government were to pass a new tax in Congress where every US American would have to pay $4 a month and $48 annually being taken out of paychecks, that would equate to over $1.72B annually. I've taken roughly 335M (US Population, some figures differ up or down) and removed 0.2% of our homeless population. It comes to roughly 288M people. 288M x $4 = $1.72B annually. This seems like a pretty affordable solution in preparing for another pandemic. Would you be willing to sacrifice $48 annually to make sure our country is well prepared and doesn't continue climbing in more debt? This way, those who are unemployed will either receive more than $600 in PUA benefits or benefits that are guaranteed for at least a year or so + more money for PPP small businesses, etc, etc. OR we could continue the UI and PUA benefits where they currently sit to save even more money, but extend those benefits for a year or more.

I am supposed to get on a plane in 2 weeks (American Airlines) from Sky Harbor and I’ve been nervous about it forever but it’s a trip that I will lose a ton of money from and have some very unhappy family if I back out (yes, I’ve already contacted airlines and lodging about refunds- not happening).

Anyway, the good news is I have an N95 mask and the airlines are requiring masks on the plane. However, AA is no longer doing the unbooked middle seat thing. 

TL;DR - if I’m wearing an N95 mask, how much risk am I exposing myself to/ how dangerous is it for me to fly out of Sky Harbor right now? Should I cancel the trip?

So she will have to attend online class at the babysitters house who does not have a computer. At the end of last year she just used a tablet, which had a ton of issues. Now the school is making a few changes. It will have her teacher more easily accessible for the kids via zoom meetings three times a day.

It seems like covid causes a build up of lipids in the lungs causing the most severe cases to require ventilation. Some younger people infected who died or had serious lung impairment, many have been obese or very overweight which may indicate they probably had high cholesterol issues. I'm hoping this discovery sheds light on potential medicines to use to prevent severe lung damage.

CoronavirusAZ,Comprearm,Repetitious History Lesson: Gov. Henry Gage and the SF Plague Outbreak of 1900-04,"\*cough\*

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry\_Gage#San\_Francisco\_bubonic\_plague\_outbreak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#San_Francisco_bubonic_plague_outbreak)

### San Francisco bubonic plague outbreak

On January 3, 1900, Gage held a legislative session to discuss ways to improve [San Francisco's port](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_San_Francisco) in attempt to increase trading with Asia. He also wanted to bring back the State Quarantine Service which had recently been removed. The federal [Marine Hospital Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Hospital_Service) on Angel Island was responsible for the inspection of all incoming ships and preventing all foreign diseases from coming into California.[\[7\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-7) Reintroduction of the State Quarantine Service would provide Gage with more oversight and ability to minimize threats of quarantine. However, the session was adjourned before any action upon the request could take place. From 1900 onwards, Gage's administration was often rocky. That year, the ship *Australia* laid anchor in the [Port of San Francisco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_San_Francisco), unknowingly bringing to the city [rats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat) carrying the [Third Pandemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_plague_pandemic) of the [bubonic plague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague).[\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-8) The disease soon made home in the cramped [ghetto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto) quarters of the city's [Chinatown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(San_Francisco)). Rumors of the plague's presence abounded in the city, quickly gaining the notice of authorities from the federal [Marine Hospital Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Hospital_Service), including the Marine Hospital Service's head in San Francisco, [Joseph J. Kinyoun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_J._Kinyoun).[\[9\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-10)[\[11\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-11)

Allied with powerful railroad and city business interests, Gage publicly denied that any pestilence outbreak in the city, fearing that any word of the [bubonic plague's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague) presence would deeply damage the city and state's economy. Supportive newspapers, such as the [*San Francisco Call*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Call), [*San Francisco Chronicle*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle) and the [*San Francisco Bulletin*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bulletin), echoed Gage's denials, beginning what was to become an intense defamation campaign against Joseph Kinyoun, director of the San Francisco Quarantine Station. In response to the state's refuting of the plague's existence, [U.S. Surgeon General](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States) [Walter Wyman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Wyman) recommended to federal [Treasury Secretary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Secretary_of_the_Treasury) [Lyman J. Gage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_J._Gage) to intervene. Secretary Gage agreed, creating a three-man medical commission to medically investigate the city. The commission conclusively discovered that bubonic plague was present.

Like Kinyoun, the Treasury commission's findings were again immediately denounced by Governor Gage. Gage believed the federal government's growing presence in the matter was a gross intrusion of what he recognized as a state concern. In his retaliation, Gage denied the federal commission any use of the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley)'s laboratories to further study the outbreak.[\[12\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-Echenberg,_Myron-12) The *Bulletin* would also attack the federal commission, branding it as a ""youthful and inexperienced trio"".

The clash between Gage and federal authorities intensified. Surgeon General Wyman instructed Kinyoun to place Chinatown under [quarantine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine), as well as blocking all [East Asians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asians) from entering state borders. Upon hearing Kinyoun’s announcement, Gage sent telegrams and spread the word to California’s elected officials, party leaders, and even delegates of the National Convention. He encouraged them to speak with the President about cancelling the quarantine and removing Kinyoun from his duties.[\[13\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-13) This event along with the help of San Francisco newspapers sparked the campaign to remove and discredit Kinyoun. Chinese residents, supported by Gage and local businesses, fought the quarantine through numerous federal court battles, claiming the [Marine Hospital Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Hospital_Service) was violating their rights under the [Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), and in the process, launched [lawsuits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit) against Kinyoun.[\[12\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-Echenberg,_Myron-12) In these court proceedings, residents insisted Gage was correct in his denials of the plague outbreak. The courts initially agreed that [Chinatown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(San_Francisco)) residents were correct in that the quarantine violated their civil rights, yet most of these lawsuits were eventually thrown out of court on later dates.

Between 1901 and 1902, the plague outbreak continued to worsen. On January 8, 1901, Gage pushed to allow the state health board members to delegate the local health units in attempt to monitor and control cases regarding the plague.[\[14\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-14) In a 1901 address to both houses of the [California State Legislature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Legislature), Gage accused federal authorities, particularly Kinyoun, for injecting [bubonic plague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague) into [cadavers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadavers).[\[15\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-skubik.com-15) In response to what he said to be massive scaremongering by the Marine Hospital Service, Gage pushed a censorship bill through the Legislature to gag any media reports of plague infection. The legislation failed, yet laws to gag reports amongst the medical community succeeded in passage and were signed into law by the governor. In addition, $100,000 was allocated to a public campaign led by Gage to deny the plague's existence. Privately, however, Gage sent a special commission to [Washington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.), consisting of [Southern Pacific](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Pacific_Railroad), newspaper and shipping lawyers to negotiate a settlement with the Marine Hospital Service, whereby the [federal government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._federal_government) would remove Kinyoun from San Francisco with the promise that the state would secretly cooperate with the Marine Hospital Service in stamping out the plague outbreak.[\[15\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-skubik.com-15)

Secret cooperations included preventive measures such as inspection, isolation and disinfection. Gage and [Mayor Phelan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Phelan) provided funding to inspect and disinfect Chinatown of any signs of the plague.[\[16\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-16) To the public, however, this was marketed as a cleanup campaign that was renovating and getting rid of the town's filth. Despite the secret agreement allowing for Kinyoun's removal, Gage went back on his promise of assisting federal authorities and continued to obstruct their efforts for study and quarantine. A report issued by the State Board of Health on September 16, 1901, bolstered Gage's claims, denying the plague's outbreak.[\[17\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gage#cite_note-17)",1,1594897744,arizona,2020-07-16 07:09:04

I mentioned to my employer that he should donate them. He said he hadn’t thought about it but would consider it.

If you have a specific organization, that would be better.this way I can relay the info to my employer.",1,1594909394,arizona,2020-07-16 10:23:14

CoronavirusAZ,pushing-up-daisies,Bar exam updates: the show must go on,"I know I won't shut up about the bar exam, so I'm sorry for sounding like a broken record everyone. The Phoenix Convention Center sent a request to host a gathering larger than 50 people to Phoenix City Attorney Cris Meyer on Monday. The Supreme Court quietly posted it on their attorney admissions website today without any comment or communication to test takers. The request, and ""safety plan"" that goes with it, is full of typos and conflicting information about what examinees can bring/can not bring and what will be provided. I haven't seen confirmation, but I'm told the City Attorney already approved the request, which is why the Court posted it. I'm furious and scared and I feel like I'm shouting into the void. I don't care that the center will use some fancy technology to disinfect every night. I'm not worried about catching the disease from touching a table. I'm worried about catching the disease from being in a room with over 200 people. 

Meanwhile, Chief Justice Brutinel issued an order that courtrooms cannot have more than 30 people in the room at once. New York cancelled their September exam. So many states have cancelled exams this week. We have the highest per capita case count, but it doesn't matter. There will be hundreds of test takers, plus tons of extra Convention Center staff and Court staff, all commingling in the same building, using the same facilities, breathing the same air. And it does. not. matter. They don't care. I don't get it. Does the Court think nothing of us? People could die and as long as we ensure ""minimum competency"" of the rest, its worth it?

I dare the justices of the Supreme Court to come sit in the exam with us if they think its so safe. They  think they know what's best, but they wouldn't dare put their own lives in danger. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I didn't defer to October because my firm needs me licensed and I need the money and honestly, I thought I could handle the stress of the July exam. But every time I see case numbers continue to skyrocket and all the deaths and that our city is overwhelmed, I want to cry. I can't concentrate. I'm terrified. I bought life insurance this week, and I'm drafting a will and medical docs next week. This is fucking insane.",1,1594936980,arizona,2020-07-16 18:03:00

CoronavirusAZ,somedumbgoth,From Press Conf: Do Deaths Increase in the Summer?,"""Every summer we do see an increase in the number of deaths"" - Dr Christ ([Source: Press Conference](https://youtu.be/zx4v8OM8nMc?t=3349))

Dr. Christ made this statement in the last two press conferences that I've been able to watch, and I went and looked it up because it seems against my common knowledge that deaths in the US go up in the winter ( [A Source](https://www.acsh.org/news/2019/07/10/more-people-die-winter-summer-14146)). I went and looked it up intending to find myself very wrong and learn that Arizona was an outlier due to heat related deaths.

Here is the link I found that the AZ Dept of Health Services provides:

&gt;[https://pub.azdhs.gov/health-stats/mu/index.php](https://pub.azdhs.gov/health-stats/mu/index.php)

I have only reviewed a few of these files (Excel downloads). It may be true that Arizona is flatter than other places, but it seems like deaths are near consistent with a possible increase in January (and one of the recent years looked like there were a few more deaths through Spring as well).

Anyway, I thought this was interesting. I'd like to know what she's talking about when she says ""every summer we do see an increase in the number of deaths"". Does anyone have any information that might point to what she's talking about?

I've captured all the data on the AZDHS site on the googlesheet linked here:

My mom fought for 2 weeks but eventually developed complications and passed on June 26th. My uncle held on longer but had developed kidney failure and required dialysis as well. His condition was stable for a long time but he just couldn't shake the double pneumonia and started having blood pressure issues. He was on the ventilator and dialysis for over a month struggling to improve but today his blood pressure dropped too low and his body finally gave out. He was only 68. My mom was 61. They were the oldest living members in our direct family and the most high risk so we took every precaution to stay safe like wearing masks, social distancing, constant disinfection of surfaces and washing hands however our state of Arizona is so lit up from Covid right now it was almost inevitable that it would eventually hit us. Saddest thing is that a few months ago when they passed the first stimulus I jokingly said that it was ""sorry you might not make it money"", I didn't realize how true that statement would be until now... I'm just in a depression induced daze and feel helpless. I know the rest of us survived but we feel far from fine...

CoronavirusAZ,stars_Ceramic,"Cause of death reporting, aka Why No One is Over-Reporting COVID-19 Deaths","I made this post on Facebook a couple of months ago and while I'm annoyed that it's still relevant, I thought it might also be useful here. I want more people to have information about this, because it makes it harder for people to continue spouting nonsense when confronted with specific information. Still possible, but it's something at least.

.......

Let's talk about causes of death, conspiracy theories, and why it's some actual nonsense to claim that unrelated deaths are being attributed to covid-19!

When I worked for Maricopa county, I was part of a small unit of about 8 people, funded by the Maricopa County Department of Vital Registration. My particular job interfaced directly with the Office of the Medical Examiner, the state Department of Epidemiology, licensed healthcare facilities (hospitals/hospices/nursing homes), and funeral homes in Maricopa county. 

The main purpose of this unit is to validate and verify causes of death for every decedent in the county who passes away at a licensed healthcare facility.

The unit also existed because the cause of death sheet itself is kind of hard to fill out, and doctors only get about a semester on it and forget it. The people working for this unit spend their work days calling individual doctors to explain errors in filling out the death certificate.

If doctors themselves are confused about how to list and understand a cause of death, OF COURSE the public doesn't understand the many nuances required.

The cause of death sheet actually has multiple parts and it is meant to indicate a process of disease, and usually not just something that happened all of a sudden.

So for example, let's make up Fictional Herbert. Fictional Herbert died because he contracted covid-19, but he also had diabetes that had been getting worse anyway. 

His cause of death would read something like ""Cardiac arrest 
due to 
Acute liver failure
caused by
Chronic Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, 
worsened by 
Acute Covid-19 infection"". 

At this point, it would come across my desk, as it was my job to report the part about the infection to epidemiology. This would have ALSO been true if they had c-diff, typhoid, polio, measles, MRSA, etc...because the job of the epidemiology department in any county or state is to monitor the spread of infectious disease. 

It doesn't mean that deaths are being miscounted. It doesn't mean that Fictional Herbert in this example keeled over of diabetes one day and now it's ""randomly"" being called a covid-19 death. Fictional Herbert would not have keeled over *at all* if he did not get covid-19, at least not yet, and that's the point that's flying over everyone's head right now.

It is such a thing to have had this job and then watch people try to scream at the top of their lungs like they're making some kind of excellent point. There is just so much bureaucracy paperwork that people don't know about. It's honestly tough to understand for the people who do it 40 hours a week, so of course most people don't know all of this.

(I've been the Big Sick and unable to work for about ~3 years but I've verified that this information is still up to date with people who currently work with this unit.)",182,1595109258,arizona,2020-07-18 17:54:18

We want to talk to a whole spectrum of people - from asymptomatic to severe illness. We would work within your availability to schedule a time to speak with you. All the interviews can be done remotely and photographs made at a safe social distance outside. It would be on the record, which means you would share your real name and age. We want to create this series to put a face to data reporting that shows that majority of cases in the state are within this age range, as well as share the personal perspectives of this particular age demographic.

The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) reported just [1,559 new cases this morning](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php). Other states obviously have the ability to process a high volume of tests but Arizona does not. [Sonora Quest has been reporting a backlog of over 60,000 tests](https://www.sonoraquest.com/latest-covid-19-news/).  
[Maricopa County ordered 14 refrigerated morgue trucks last week](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/07/17/repeating-nys-nightmare-texas-and-arizona-request-refrigerated-trucks-for-filling-morgues/#39a90b342214). Of the processed tests that are actually reported, our positivity rate has been around 20% for weeks. [Our rate of infection is the highest in the world when each US state is treated as an individual country](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/briefing/arizona-mary-trump-facebook-your-wednesday-briefing.html). The numbers reported by ADHS and information spouted by Ducey and Christ at their press conferences just do not match up with the reality of what's actually happening in Arizona.  
What needs to happen? What support does Arizona need to process the [100,000 backlogged tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusAZ/comments/hun7w3/july_20th_adhs_summary/fyo35o3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)? This is just unacceptable 7 months into this pandemic to have this issue. Is it incompetence, lack of caring, or an intentional attempt to keep the residents of Arizona from knowing what the situation actually is?

How many people will go homeless? How many will lose their electricity, their A/C in this 120 degree heat? How many more must die? 

Are teachers and students going to be used as guinea pigs for reopening? Why does every other government agency get phased opening (Customs and Immigration, State Department, IRS, etc) but schools are just to be opened without consideration or phasing in? What is this madness? Why are teachers expendable but IRS agents are protected? Aren't we ALL humans? I hate America and I hate the greed of those who control it. We need to take back our country, but I don't know what to do other than vote. Even protestors are silenced. We are heading towards a government collapse and we will end up like China or Russia if we haven't already.

CoronavirusAZ,yodarded,"My case for the AZ Testing Backlog Hovering between 67,000 and 73,000 for the last 15 days","I don't know if this is a welcome analysis or not, but I no longer believe that the testing backlog is growing. It appears that the testing backlog is leveling out, which means that the current state administration, however incompetent, at least isn't continuing to fall further behind on testing.

I have defined the Testing Backlog as: Tests Reported in July (currently 317,287) minus Tests Completed with an Administration Date in July (currently sums to 249,875). This only assumes that June is complete; to the extent that it wasn't complete for any day would lead that number to be off by a few percent, but I'm certain that this week's numbers are within 1%.

So for July 21st, 317,287 - 249,875 = **a testing backlog of 67,412**

Its tempting to believe that if [Sonora Quest Labs by itself has a backlog of over 61,000](https://www.sonoraquest.com/latest-covid-19-news/), when we include the other labs in the state we must be approaching 100,000 or even over it. But according to [this article by Reuters and Sonora COO Sonya Engle,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-testing-arizona/arizonas-main-covid-lab-running-behind-as-demand-for-tests-soars-to-twice-capacity-idUSKBN23U3C8) **Sonora Labs is responsible for approximately 80% of Arizona's COVID-19 tests. Working it backwards, Sonora's backlog of 61,132 would about 80% of a 76,000 total backlog for AZ.** I would chalk up the difference between my calculation and this estimate to different infection rates based on different population densities, but im open to being 10% off. That these two numbers are close based on two completely different approaches, I think is solid evidence that they are both in the correct neighborhood. And if we want the media to take our alerts seriously, its important that we don't discredit ourselves with exaggerated claims, imho.

**TL;DR My estimates for the last 15 days, around 70,000,** ***might*** **be low... but I've concluded its very unlikely Arizona's testing backlog has ever been over 80,000.**

(P.S. Its actually trending downward for the last 5 days, but at only 500 a day I'm not sure that's worth mentioning...)

The state reports the New PCR+Serology Cases each day, the number of each type of test and the cumulative %+ve rate for each test, but not the daily +ve rate for each test.

Taking this available data, (from 1st July) I estimated the number of new +ve serology cases each day.  These are then subtracted from the daily new case total to get the PCR daily +ve cases.  From these I've calculated the 7-day moving average (which smooths the bumps)

**It indicates the current PCR +ve rate is \~23% (± 2%), essentially stable for the last 10 days.**

The data also indicate the serology +ve rate has increased from \~5% at the beginning of July to about 15% now.  N.B.  This **does not mean the community antibody +ve rate is 15%**, as I assume the people getting a serology test are a biased sample of the community, i.e., you're more likely to get a serology test if you previously has a +ve PCR test.",11,1595534801,arizona,2020-07-23 16:06:41

July 23, 2020
Executive Order Changes to a Data-Based Approach to Resuming Instruction

Gov. Doug Ducey today released another executive order (EO 2020-51) that changes the approach to reopening schools away from a date certain to an approach based on data, and attempts to bring clarity to requirements around “free onsite learning” as well as clarify district ability to pay staff. Today’s order has several components:
Reopening of Schools for Traditional or Hybrid Instruction

• Directs the Arizona Department of Health Services to develop metrics based on public health data that will indicate when it is safe to resume “in-person, teacher-led instruction” by August 7th, 2020.

• Requires these metrics to be aligned with CDC Guidance.

• Allows governing boards to consider these metrics, along with guidance from county health officials, to decide when it is safe to resume in-person, teacher-led instruction.

Note: This means that schools will not be forced to reopen for traditional or hybrid instruction based on a date certain. Instead, DHS will provide a set of data points that would indicate reduced spread of COVID-19 within the community. Once those have been met, the ultimate decision to reopen rests with the governing board.

Distance Learning

• Directs each school district to begin distance learning beginning on the first day of the district’s instructional calendar submitted to ADE.

• Requires distance learning plans to be submitted by August 14 or the first day of distance learning, whichever is first.

• Explicitly states distance learning instruction counts toward minimum instructional hours requirements for in-person learning (A.R.S. §§15-341.01 and 15-901).

• States distance learning will be funded at the same rate as Arizona Online Instruction (AOI), with districts eligible for additional funding from the Enrollment Stability Grant program.

Free Onsite Learning Opportunities &amp; Support Services

• Directs school districts and charter schools to begin offering “free onsite learning opportunities and support services for students who need a place to go during the day” as required by EO 2020-41 beginning August 17.
• Specifies all school districts and charter schools are obligated to provide these services. (Note: Neither this order nor any previous order specifies HOW these opportunities/services are to be provided.)
   
• Allows districts and charters to adopt procedures to allow for a reduced capacity of students to allow for physical distancing or other mitigation measures.

•Allows districts and charters to apply to ADE for a waiver if the school is ordered closed by county health officials or a tribal nation issues a “stay at home” order.)

(Note: Prioritizing based on need, staggering times/availability ad different sites, designating a single site withing the district, or partnering with external organizations may all be possibilities. The order is silent on these topics.)

Family/Parental Notification

• Requires districts and charters to take steps to notify parents and guardians of school district operations:

• Post the district or charter’s distance learning plan on its website.

• Notify parents/guardians of the requirements to keep a child enrolled in school and the minimum level of contact required to maintain enrollment under the distance learning plan.

• Post its mitigation plan prior to opening its building(s) for return to in-person instruction or on-site learning opportunities and support services.

• Post on its website the district or charter’s plan to offer free on-site learning and support services, and notify all parents of this opportunity, especially parents/guardians of students with disabilities, English Learners, students who participate in free/reduced price lunch, foster children, and students who are in the custody of the Department of Child Safety.

Face Coverings
• Requires all school districts and charter schools to adopt a policy mandating face coverings (masks or shields) for all staff and students over the age of 5, until the department of health services determines face coverings are no longer needed to prevent the spread of the virus.

• Exceptions shall be made for students who are outdoors, physically distant, or both, and for “break periods” when students may safely remove their face coverings.

• Mandates other CDC recommendations be incorporated.

•States face coverings should not be worn by anyone under 2, or suffering from other specific conditions.

Staff Pay

• Specifically allows school districts and charter schools to continue to pay staff if the public school determines such payments are necessary.

• The employee remains committed and available to work during the employee’s regular work hours, or during school closures, performance of duties remotely or other alternative assignments.

Conflict/Severability

• States if any provision of this executive order conflicts with EO 2020-41, or EO 2020-44 the provisions of this EO will govern.

• Contains a severability clause. Previous Executive Orders

MY THOUGHTS:

This order creates some space for school districts and governing boards to make quick and important decisions the Governor, in his insane refusal to LEAD, has not been willing to make. As he has done in other situations (such as refusing to order a statewide mandate on masks and instead relying on the cities and counties to do it for him), Ducey is once again stuffing his head in the sand and letting other people make the hard choices... but at least he's getting out of the way and giving schools the opportunity to do SOMETHING.

Schools will have to provide some on-site learning opportunities, but in this context that means SPED services, food services, and child care - the school doesn't have to lead those services with certified teachers, and could manage them with support staff (aides etc). People who complain that their kids need to go somewhere will have that option from their local district, even if they chose not to open up in-person this quarter. I assume that in terms of instruction, this would mean the student could attend the online distance-education class, from a location on campus, if they so desired. A teacher wouldn't be present, but a support staff likely will.

The school board can choose not to open in-person instruction and the days of school that are turned into ""remote learning"" will be counted toward the 180 days of mandatory in-person learning. They'll count the remote learning days as in-person days during the outbreak. This is a big deal for districts that have already chosen to push back opening dates to the end of the first quarter, as it ensures they'll be able to meet the 180 day school criteria without having to extend the school year into next summer.

Support staff will be retained and continue to be paid even during a closure. Schools will be responsible for finding ways to put them to work during this crisis.

Eventually (by August 7th), the AZ Dept of Health Services will release guidelines to help guide school reopening plans, giving some kind of metric-based guide that will allow School Boards to decide when they are going to return to the classroom. This is taking so long because of failures of leadership to make a real plan in the months we've had to prepare for this. They kicked the can, and kicked the can, and here we are. 

When these metrics arrive, they are merely metrics to be considered, and the school board is ultimately responsible for the decision. A red-hat school board might decide to kill its teachers, regardless of the metrics. A good board might decide to push back in-person learning, making the hard but NECESSARY choice. Ducey said he wants schools to have the flexibility to make these choices on their own (his ""leadership"" shines through again, where he passes the buck and refuses to make an actual hard decision).

This means a school board can absolutely choose not to open schools to in-person learning and teachers on-site if they so desire. Overnight, several districts have already made moves toward pushing back the start date of school until October (end of First Quarter). If you go dig through school board docs for districts, you'll see several of them have posted up intentions to hold a new board meeting with an agenda related to pushing back the in-person education date.

I urge all school districts to follow suit. Pushing back the start date to after Fall Break in October is the most sensible choice for our schools today. 

For any of my fellow teachers staring down the barrel at this insanity, I hope this helps you steer your admin in an intelligent direction. The question to ask is very simple: 

""Is there a level of outbreak that would DEFINTITELY mean we shouldn't be inviting students back for in-person teaching?""

If the answer to that question is yes, the response is very simple.

""Would the county with the absolute worst outbreak in the entire world per-capita be an example of just such a place?""

That's where we're living. We are the global epicenter of this disease. We're not #2, or #5. Our numbers would be EVEN WORSE if they worked through the 60,000+ test backlog in a timely fashion. Even if you believed that we might not be #1, and that our numbers might put us at #1, or #5, or #10... shouldn't schools in the top ten infection zones in the entire world remain shut down for the safety of students, staff, and the community? It is not safe to open schools here, in the worst local outbreak on the planet. We could debate this if we were talking about a state with low community spread and a handle on the transmission of Covid. We're not living in that magical world. Based purely on the numbers, it is a mathematical certainty that every single day, children or adults with coronavirus will be on school campus, sharing air with hundreds or thousands of people. Our confirmed infection rate is high enough that a room full of just 25 random people has a nearly 100% chance of having an infected person present. Schools cannot be blanket reopened to the public under those conditions. Pushing back start-dates to October to buy more time for vaccines such as the Oxford or Moderna to work through phase three trials is the right choice. We are mass producing vaccine as I type this, preparing to release these vaccines to the public if phase 3 trials demonstrate relative safety. We will have SOLUTIONS to this virus soon, and killing teachers, parents, students, and support staff needlessly in the meantime is not an acceptable course of action.

And if I'm wrong, and no such vaccine is on the horizon due to failed phase 3 trials... schools are STILL unsafe to open, and we must get control of the spread of this virus in the WORST INFECTION ZONE ON THE PLANET before we put a thousand kids into a big box with windows that don't open and an air conditioning system literally designed to keep air IN. 

If boards vote to open schools to in-person learning on the 17th, we will pay for that decision in human lives.",28,1595606696,arizona,2020-07-24 12:04:56

*Caveat: I'm not in human resources, nor do I have any insights into any of the companies I will be posting about. I just didn't love my last job and I enjoyed finding my new role. Looking for jobs is soothing to me. It doesn't add stress to my life, it actually makes me feel like I'm helping out from home - because like most of you, I'm doing everything in my power to #stayhome #staysafe*

I had some fun the past couple days helping other users find remote opportunities they may not have been aware existed.

What I need from you in order to search - DMs are open for this if you don't want to dox yourself or your job requirements:

* Current title/industry
* Desired title
* Location (metro)
* Years of experience you have.
* Salary requirements
* education/certifications you have (security clearances too!)
* anything else you want to tell me

I have a subscription to FlexJobs which I will be using for this; all responses will be sent in the form of chat messages (unless you want me to put it all out there in this post); I will try to send each person 4-6 opportunities.  A FlexJobs subscription is $50/year - if you want to see more, I'm sure they'd be happy to help you out.

Nomenclature used for sending job opportunities:

CoronavirusAZ,LooseKnit,How seriously some districts/schools are NOT taking this.,"Quick note that this is my first post ever on Reddit and I’ve been following this sub since there were less than 3K members, love that it’s grown into an amazingly informative and supportive place for these insanely hard times. Appreciate everyone’s work!

My oldest is starting fourth grade remotely on Monday - yep, this coming Monday, 7/27 - and I joined her virtual “Meet The Teacher” yesterday.

Her teacher is an older woman who admitted to struggling with the technology which, I completely understand (I work in Tech so my daughter hasn’t struggled through remote learning so far), but at the close of the session her comments were: an exasperated focus on wanting to “get back to normal and just have this whole thing be over” and most inoperable to be back in the classroom ASAP. Zero comments around safety plans or the seriousness of the pandemic, just get those butts in those seats, people. 

I also watched the “Welcome!” video from her principal and he and the school faculty member in the video with him were standing right next to each other, no masks, and their emphasis was how excited they are to get back into the classroom ASAP.

I’ve attended two remote memorial services so far and severed toxic ties with family members and long term friends who don’t acknowledge or outright downplay the situation we’re in right now because 1) SCIENCE AND FACTUAL NUMBERS and 2) fuck ‘em that’s why.

It’s just so disheartening; I’m fortunate that my job is fully remote but the push to start ON MONDAY in this district and the lack of any kind of plan beyond “this thing will go away let’s back in the classroom!” is just mind blowing. Another show of the trickle down effect of Ducey’s lack of leadership.

&amp;#x200B;

After Ducey's press conference on Thursday, it's clear we still need to forge ahead. We have continued to build our foundation over the last two weeks and gain more insight into what we are getting into. Arizonans continue to struggle with schooling, adequate health resources, finances, job-loss, homelessness. Meanwhile, Ducey finds it more important to deflate our testing numbers to continue his smoke and mirrors routine. In the few days leading up to his press conference our values for tests processed plummeted while our percent positive rate continued to hover far too high, around 25% positive. He used this as a way to display graphs that show Arizona now in the ""green"" zone for certain virus numbers. However, number of positive tests IS NOT the value to be watching when he is clearly manipulating the data. Our percent positive rate, our high test turnaround times, our hospitalizations INCLUDING the number of people being sent to New Mexico or neighboring state, these are all values that Ducey needs to talk about. 

With only two weeks before his start-date for schools to reopen, he finally changes his tune to listen to scientists and healthcare officials. What exactly are those values that will determine when schools can reopen? Well, he doesn't actually know yet. Sir, how can we continue to put faith in a system that doesn't know what values determine the state is safe? How can we achieve those numbers if we don't know what they are? How can we be sure those numbers are accurate when our tests take 7.5 days on average to process results? How can we continue to urge people to be tested when they have to wait in a car in 112 degree heat when sick with COVID-19 for 10 hours to only MAYBE receive the results before being admitted to the hospital or dying from the virus?

Our organization has pushed back our file date for the petition towards mid-August. Help us meet that deadline by spreading the word, joining our cause and making your voice heard! Arizonans are sick of being sick!",1,1595693111,arizona,2020-07-25 12:05:11

There have been so many large, maskless public events in my small town. Gun show, car show, rodeo, sports tournaments; downtown is packed daily. People even organized and held a 4th of July ""protest"" parade after the event was cancelled. 


Communication from the school district said that the majority of parents will be sending their children back for in-person classes with no mask requirements. The district ""supports anyone who chooses to do so"", but they are not mandatory. I'm in the minority and my kids are in online school for the semester. We have been social distancing and I have been teleworking since March, but I don't see the same in my community and it is hard to see how things will improve.

Employees that had contact with someone that tested positive, even a family member/coworker/roommate of which they have repeated contact, can continue working until they receive a test result. The reason most employees will not voluntarily isolate during the time before they receive their results is because QT will NOT pay for their leave until a positive test result comes back. This also means after an employee gets tested, they will most likely work through the period that they were supposed to be isolating anyway, because of how long test results are taking to come back in AZ. I do not support this and how little the company has done to ensure customer safety throughout this pandemic.

If any other employees of QT or other essential business are on this subreddit and want to back this post or share a story please do, Arizonans deserve to know what is going on at the places they visit.

CoronavirusAZ,divinerosekeeper,Embry Women’s Health Testing Sites No Longer Using Sonora Quest,"Didn’t see anyone else post about this on here. But I had tested at the Rio Salado testing site on 7/14 (with no results still” and received this email from Embry Women’s Health Sunday morning:


“Embry Women's Health


We are writing to you today to share an update on COVID-19 test results. Patients that had an appointment between 07/11/2020 and 07/18/2020 are receiving this message. If you have already received your result please disregard. 

During this period our test sites used several lab facilities including Sonora Quest, LabCorp and ProPath. Sonora Quest is the only facility that has not reported results for this time period. It is our primary concern and the reason that we want to update you. 

To keep this message simple and brief. Sonora Quest is currently reporting out results from patients who were tested on Saturday 7/11/2020 and Sunday 7/12/2020. Which is absolutely unacceptable. This is over 12 days after the patient visited one of our test sites. 

To put this in perspective, if you were tested on 7/14/2020 based on their current turnaround time Sonora Quest will report your result this Monday 7/27/2020. 

As a direct result of their performance in turn around time, Sonora Quest was terminated from the list of lab facilities used for COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing. This was effective the weekend of Saturday 7/18/2020. We have not sent any specimens to Sonora Quest since that time. Nor do we plan to do so in the immediate future. 

Sonora Quest is currently holding over 62,000 COVID-19 specimens in storage at their Tempe facility. Many of which have been there for over 10 days. Based on our average daily volume we estimate that over 7,000 of these specimens are from our patients.

This topic has been covered multiple times in the media in recent days. Which has helped to shed light on the issue. However, we do not consider the solutions provided as an acceptable resolution. AZ Family recently discussed it writing ""On Sonora Quest's website, it shows as of Wednesday, there are nearly 62,000 pending tests. When Arizona’s Family asked Sonora Quest about this, they said they’re working to reduce turnaround time and appreciate patience as they deal with increased demand for testing.""

Once the turnaround time with Sonora Quest was no longer acceptable and did not improve, we worked to find a new lab. Embry Women's Health has partnered Northwest Pathology which is located in Washington State. They have committed to a 2 to 4 business day turnaround time. A majority of specimens have been sent there since Saturday 7/18/2020. With all test sites now being fully switched over. They have delivered on their commitment to turn around time to report results. 

We are immediately calling on Sonora Quest to release those specimens that are in holding. If you are waiting on your results, these are your specimens. While they are over capacity, the only solution is to send to another lab. They must partner with additional labs, such as Northwest Pathology to ensure that our patients are able to get their results. It is no longer acceptable to simply say that they are working to reduce the backlog. 

An additional email will be sent out to all patients later this weekend providing more information. We invite you at any time to retest at one of the test sites. Tests collected on Monday would most likely report out early Thursday morning.

Thank you”",1,1595854266,arizona,2020-07-27 08:51:06

CoronavirusAZ,skitch23,Seeing a high percent positive for backlogged tests.,"I was just looking at the data some more during a break from work. 904 of our 1,813 cases came from tests done July 11-14. After checking out the number of tests done each of those days it was pretty easy to see our percent positive since all of the serology tests had already been analyzed so they were all PCR tests reported today.

July 11:

- 112 cases. 528 tests (533 PCR, -5 serology). 21.2% positivity.

July 12:

- 125 cases. 483 tests (483 PCR, 0 serology). 25.9% positivity.

July 13:

- 422 cases. 1,852 tests (1,853 PCR, -1 serology). 22.8% positivity.

July 14:

- 245 cases. 1,235 tests (1,236 PCR, -1 serology). 19.8% positivity.

That's **22.1% overall** that were sick and waiting for results for TWO WEEKS. How many of those people do you think went out and did stuff during that time instead of remaining isolated at home?

I'll try to figure out how to easily incorporate this in my post on the daily update... it just might take me a couple days to get it ironed out.",1,1595887102,arizona,2020-07-27 17:58:22

CoronavirusAZ,GriffySchnauzMom,COVID test negative but concerned if the result can be trusted - thoughts?,"So I went through the CVS drive-thru testing Friday afternoon, about 3:30-ish, for my test. I've not felt well for about a week now and learned Saturday I had possibly been exposed so I was glad I went ahead and got a test. I was told it would be 6-10 business days before I received the results (of course) and that I would receive an email when the results did come in to check the online portal through MyChart.

I decided to go ahead and check the portal on my own just to see if anything had come through even though I hadn't received an email because I'm just impatient and want answers. Well wouldn't you know, there was a test result! I was happy to see it so soon and saw that it returned a negative result, no other information. At first, I was relieved, then I became a little concerned, for a few reasons. 

I understand there's a fairly high incidence of false negatives. If I was feeling better I wouldn't give this much thought but given that I don't, it gives me pause. The time that the test was collected was 1:00am on Saturday morning. I figure people might be working around the clock on tests but this was what, 9 hours after I took it? I don't know what lab they're using but they must be backlogged to an extent, they said it would be 6-10 business days (so two weeks) but then they have a result in 12 hours? And no email regarding the result either. I just find it odd.

I guess the bottom line is I don't know if I trust these results and would like to see what you guys think. We all know about the huge backlog and the wait time for test results in general, which is why this seems weird. I'm not a conspiracy theorist by any means, I simply don't want to expose anyone to anything and make sure I have as accurate a test as possible.",1,1595955605,arizona,2020-07-28 13:00:05

COVID-19 testing sites in south Phoenix see fewer people show up,"https://www.azfamily.com/news/continuing_coverage/coronavirus_coverage/testing-blitz-or-bust-covid-19-testing-sites-in-south-phoenix-see-fewer-people-show/article_1f9f5376-d119-11ea-b5bf-0fa9b9aeafb4.html

PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) - Two government testing sites, one at Maryvale High and the other at South Mountain Park, ended Tuesday with far fewer people showing up then they had hoped for.

Organizers had hoped to test 60,000 Arizonans but only around 13,000 got tested. Part of the reason could be is that there’s still too many hoops for people to jump through.

Meanwhile, another testing site kicked off Tuesday, put on by local nonprofits, where all that is required is your ID.

Earlier this month, cars wrapped around the campus at South Mountain Community College as people waited up to eight hours to get tested.
From that line to Tuesday, hosted by the same nonprofits, there were just a few dozen cars waiting at Cesar Chavez Park near Baseline Road and 35th Avenue.

“Some people have had some bad experiences not getting the test back and reasonable amount of time some people not getting them back at all. There’s been some things in the news people might get turned off about,” said organizer Jarvis Reddick with the American Legion Post 65.

According to Reddick, not only will people see shorter wait times, but a quicker turnaround with results back in five to seven days. He is encouraging people to keep getting tested.
“If they came across, they will see there’s hardly any wait at all. We get you in and out,” said Reddick.

Viri Hernandez from Poder in Action, a Latino Advocacy group, said another reason she believes turnout at federal sites was low was the requirement that people register beforehand and a lack of bilingual outreach.

“The technology gap, people don’t have access to technology. They don’t have language access to sign up and register,” said Hernandez.

No registration is required at this testing site at Cesar Chavez Park. Just bring a valid form of identification.

The tests are taking place behind the library from Tuesday to Saturday this week as well as next week from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m.",1,1595998676,arizona,2020-07-29 00:57:56

CoronavirusAZ,PattyRain,Scammer Alert From Sonora Quest,"Just got an email from Sonora Quest:

""To our valued patients,
	""During times of crisis, scammers look for opportunities to gain personal information from unsuspecting people.
""	It has been brought to our attention by patients and the media that scammers may be posing on the phone as Sonora Quest representatives to gain patients’ personal information by claiming they have COVID-19 test results. This is called an “Imposter Scam.”
	""Sonora Quest may return calls to patients regarding accessing their results, but we do not provide COVID-19 results or collect payment over the phone unless initiated by the patient. Sonora Quest’s normal protocol is to provide results to the ordering physician for them to relay those results to the patient so they can provide next steps for care based on a patient’s full medical history.  
""	Additionally, based on the regulations and expected coverage for testing, Sonora Quest is not billing patients for COVID-19 PCR or antibody testing when it is ordered by a physician. These tests are likely to be covered by insurance, if the physician’s order meets the insurer’s medical coverage guidelines, resulting in a zero out-of-pocket expense. We work directly with your insurance, or the Department of Health and Human Services for those who are uninsured. Note that this does not include direct-access testing for COVID antibodies that is self-ordered through My Lab ReQuest™ when payment is due at time of service.
""	Patients can always obtain their test results by contacting their ordering physician or visiting www.sonoraquest.com/results and securely logging into their patient account.
	""Patients are encouraged to visit our coronavirus resources page (https://www.sonoraquest.com/coronavirus) for more information on COVID-19, access to results, testing, and billing.
	""Please be diligent before providing personal information to anyone over the phone.

			 				

""Tips to Avoid Imposter Scams

			 				

		Know that Sonora Quest will never ask for your Social Security number over the phone.

		Be aware that Sonora Quest will not contact you to pay for COVID-19 testing over the phone.

		Verify the phone number calling you and call back to be sure it is a Sonora Quest number, if unsure.

		If you did not order a test, do not provide any of your information. Hang up immediately.""",1,1596041987,arizona,2020-07-29 12:59:47

CoronavirusAZ,milliejoe,Chipotle's COVID19 Response,"\[QT employee post a few days ago\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusAZ/comments/hymmfg/quiktrips\_covid19\_response/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusAZ/comments/hymmfg/quiktrips_covid19_response/)) inspired me to say something about my own experience.

Several of the health and safety measures Chipotle has publicly touted in response to fighting COVID19 in their stores are exaggerations and, in some cases, flat out lies. Chipotle customers have a right to know a few things:

\- While it's true the majority of guests are wearing masks when entering the restaurant, mask use is not enforced. Chipotle’s public statements tout their new mask requirement for all guests, though our internal communications (through encrypted means, mind you) tell us that the store employees are forbidden to mention \*\*anything\*\* to an unmasked guest, and you are required to serve the guest anyway. I inquired about this to a higher-up, and she said that, “we want to be available to all guests who choose to visit our restaurants” (???).

\- Social distancing of guests is not enforced, nor are limited indoor capacity requirements being enforced. There are stickers on the floor to mark the 6’ distance between people standing in line, however, we aren’t supposed to be saying anything to a guest that is not adhering.

\- The appearance is that indoor capacity is being limited, however, we are discouraged from asking a guest to stand outside when too many people get into line/multiple people are grouped together around waiting for a takeout order (even though that’s what the on-paper policy dictates). Sometimes this leads to having 40 people in the restaurant at a time (including staff).

\- Even though we have tables with signs on them blocking them off to guests to maintain ≤ 50%, guests commonly move the “closed” signs off the table and sit there anyway. And, you guessed it, we are not to ask the guest to move.

\- Chipotle touts that, and I quote, ""We have added a dedicated team member responsible for continuously cleaning, sanitizing, and directing pickup orders to assist with physical distancing."" This is a lie; the position is non-existent. mUsT sAvE lAbOr!!

\- Hazard pay ended for employees about 1.5 months ago, despite Chipotle continuing to brag they are currently giving this to employees. Employees are still given 2 weeks pay if they get sick with the virus, though this is \*\*completely contingent\*\* upon the receipt of a positive lab test result (good luck getting results in less than 2 weeks).

\- Social distancing between employees is non-existent. Masks are being supplied by the company, though they are made of craft =grade felt. We died laughing when they were passed out to us. It's true we can wear any mask we choose, though some choose to wear their masks only over their mouth and not their noses, which is allowed.

&amp;#x200B;

I doubt I would be straight up fired for directing a guest to adhere to any of these guidelines, however the structure of our positions and the organization of the restaurant makes it impossible for the employees to maintain these parameters for guests, while also performing normal duties. Many of these things are just logistical failures that happen because of indoor dining being allowed, and the high volume of people going in and out, people walking past each other to pay/grab their takeout order/exit and enter the building etc. I am sure many of these issues are not unique to Chipotle. Businesses is great, which means the work is stable, for which I am grateful. But I feel incredibly susceptible to infection/spreading infection to community by spending 40 hours in this environment compared to my family or friend's compared work environments, and do not feel supported in my fears- like I’m the crazy one for wanting to \*feel\* protected.

TL;DR: You’re being given a false sense of security by restaurants who claim they are taking drastic measures to combat the virus. Dining inside of an airconditioned, busy, corporate chain restaurant is the last thing I would be doing right now in Maricopa county, considering the community spread of this virus, and how incompatible these guidelines are with a restaurant open for dine-in.

CoronavirusAZ,Natalicious-Keto,FDA Approved COVID Home Test Kits," I see a lot of discussion about the lack of available  testing  or the backlog here in Arizona and I was faced with that reality as I was contemplating a trip I had booked back in January to go fishing in Alaska.

The State of Alaska requires all visitors to arrive with proof of a negative test result that was taken within 72 hours of your arrival.  They also had free nasal swab testing at a kiosk in baggage claim but after August 11th that option is no longer available.  Besides, travelers were still required to quarantine til they got their test result and that was not an option for me.   

In the end, I cancelled my trip as going fishing was not an essential reason and air travel is not something I feel like doing right now.  Before I made that decision, I did a lot of research on my options and found that the State of Alaska seemed to understand that getting a test was not always easy and provided these FDA approved home test kit links in one of their travel websites.  They vary in price but do provide options for those of us wanting to get tested. 

I thought I'd share the links - feel free to do your own research.  I have not ordered any of these test kits but may if I feel like I need to get tested.

***COVID-19 Home Test Kits:***  
If there are limitations to testing in your home town, there are FDA approved home test kits that are also accepted by the State of Alaska. Those are:

CoronavirusAZ,Kines_Researcher,Help us understand if physical activity and fitness levels influence COVID symptoms (academic research),"Hello everyone,

I hope you don't mind, but we think this study might be of interest to some individuals living in Arizona.

We (researchers from the University of the Fraser Valley, BC, Canada) are looking for individuals (19+ years of age) who have had COVID-19 (as indicated by a +ive test) and are of ***any*** fitness level to complete an online survey. The online survey consist of 3 parts: demographic variables, COVID-19 symptoms, and physical activity/fitness levels prior to being infected. The survey takes about 6-8 minutes to complete.

The aim of our study is to learn if physical activity levels have any influence on the number of symptoms, durations and severity of symptoms, as well as any complications associated with having COVID-19.

CoronavirusAZ,Jelfff,(1) Interactive COVID-19 map showing recent trends per county and (2) downloadable csv files with case and death counts per day for each county starting March 24,"As a public service I produce an **interactive map** that uses COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University to tell at a glance whether the number of new cases or deaths in each county is trending up or trending down.  The information for the map is updated each night.

The symbols on the map summarize the recent trends as follows:

Circle		Prior 14 days

Triangle	        Prior 7 days

Green		Good - numbers are trending down

Red		Bad - numbers are trending up

**Click any symbol for the prior 14 day counts for that county.**  (A few symbols on the map represent cities.)

Open the map and show data about new cases:

The map has a number of overlays that you can turn on/off.  You can display data about recent cases or recent deaths.  The data can be displayed by county, by state or by country.

If you need help using the map, please read the **“Map tips”** (link in upper left corner).

The data that Johns Hopkins is curating is a cumulative count of cases and deaths for all counties in the USA.  You can find that data on their GitHub page at:

[https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

I wrote code that **converts the Johns Hopkins timeseries \*cumulative\* counts into \*daily\* counts of cases and deaths for all counties**.  These daily counts begin March 24th and are in csv files that anyone can download and import into GIS or spreadsheet software.  I made a PDF with details about (1) the interactive map and (2) these csv files.

I haven't worked since March, and my return date isn't until October (assuming it doesn't get delayed a third time.) For obvious reasons, I'm having trouble making ends meet.  I applied for rental assistance through the state on 6/13 and my case has been ""under counselor review"" since then.  When I initially called them to get more information, they said they couldn't help me because I applied online and they didn't have access to any of my information. Like, really??

I was told I needed to call on Monday morning at 8am to schedule an in-person appointment. Sidenote: Once the allotted appointment time slots have been filled, you must call again the following Monday.  For the last eight consecutive weeks, I begin calling at 8am.  That's two fucking months!  Sit on hold for an hour, they hang up. Call back, sit on hold for another hour, they hang up. Call back the third time... ""All appointments have been filled, please call back next Monday.""

We have reached over 8,000 members- wow! 

Welcome new members and THANK YOU to existing members who make this community a nice place to visit despite the subject matter. 

For both new and existing members- please take the time to review the rules for this sub. We’ve been pretty lax with the rules because we’re all adults, but it seems like some things are getting a little out of control. As much as I love participating in this sub, it breaks my heart to see some of the things that I do. 

Please feel free to report posts or comments that look like they break the rules. u/jerrpag and I review the reports often, but not constantly. Feel free to tag us in comments or threads as well if you think it needs our immediate attention. Please don’t report posts that you just disagree with (you’d be surprised)...

Before posting any news links, please check that it hasn’t already been posted. Questions, observations, or rants belong in the daily discussion instead of their own posts. 

We want to keep this sub as it is intended - a scientific and data driven platform for members of our community. We’re all here for information and support regarding Covid-19.  

Any questions or feedback, please let us know!",1,1596483177,arizona,2020-08-03 15:32:57

We have a meeting set up for Friday with his teachers because he’s on an IEP.   (10th grade) 

We had requested iSchool back in July. His school counselor called to confirm and said “no problem”. Monday night, the night before school starts we were told he would need to attend “remote learning”. His IEP would not be a good fit for iSchool. [There’s less help with iSchool](https://imgur.com/gallery/UYYM1WH) Which means, as soon as Doucey opens schools again, he will be required to attend. 

I’m so mad. I have Lupus. My ex husband has heart failure, we both would be fucked. (We live separate, but he does have his weekends with his dad, he has been working from home and locked down) We have been “locked down” since March and now it will all be for nothing if he’s required to return to campus. We have a full household, none of us want to get sick. 

Any advise or questions I should ask? They told me if this doesn’t work for him, they can transfer him to iSchool. I’m so frustrated bc I obviously want what’s best for my son academically, but this isn’t a virus to expose or experiment with. 

Why wouldn’t they have accommodations for students who are on IEP’s with iSchool? They have had months to prepare for this.",1,1596661676,arizona,2020-08-05 17:07:56

CoronavirusCA,Soujyo,Making a difference,"Honestly, I'm not sure if this is the place to share it, but I'd like to any ways. :)

Lately it feels like a lot of us have been feeling really quite powerless in this whole situation around Covid. Be it mounting frustrations from waiting on the Federal and State governments to take seemingly obvious action to slow the spread. Or watching people decide to throw caution to the wind as they gamble on potentially hazardous forms of entertainment (4th of July Parties for example).

Resulting in a range of emotions like anger, fear, and even sadness or depression. Which are all genuinely reasonable given the daunting challenge ahead of us. Many of us, understandably,  have withdrawn into our own little bubbles of safety, opting to let *'the system'* sort out the problem at hand while we look after our family and ourselves.

The inherent flaw with this, is that each and every one of us is (to a degree) responsible for the ultimate outcome of the issues that lay before us.

We can all make a little differences, each contributing to a better overall future for all of us. I took the liberty to offer a few suggestions, but all of you have the power to positively effect your local environment in **your own way**:

1. Instead of jumping to anger &amp; shouting at people who seem to not understand the severity of the situation. Try using compassion, logic, and a bit of patience, at worst it cost you a bit of time.  
*- ""honey catches more flies than vinegar""*
2. It's easy to look at everyone else as a potential 'enemy' right now.  Treat them in the manner in which you'd like to be treated back. Remember, they're just as likely going through some tough times too.
3. A good deed, no matter how small or to whom, can have incredibly positive consequences for both you and them. Every bit counts when in trying times.
4. Going stir-crazy is understandable, but seek out low risk means of entertainment. Get creative, you might even find a new passion! (Avoid social get togethers, party next year, the risk is not worth it!)
5. Local politicians are swimming in a sea of anger from all sides. Too often we break off contact once they accomplish what we asked of them. When they do something right (even if slower than desired), we need to remember to stick around and show support, let them know what they did right! 
6. Take some of your newfound time to educate yourself on the upcoming local and federal elections. Tough times often provide more power to the voice to the average person, use it!
7. Lastly, **be kind to yourself**. It's OK to be stressed about the uncertainty, it's OK to not have all the answers. You will get through this, and things will get better.

I hope all of you have a wonderful day, and stay safe out there!",1,1593629178,california,2020-07-01 14:46:18

I live in San Francisco and need to commit to preschool admission next few days. What would you do? We are leaning towards enrollment as school practices are safe but it comes down to how careful adults are. In other countries more transmissions adult to adult and adult to child than children as vector.

CoronavirusCA,Noanswer_merelyapath,July 4th weekend Public Service Announcement [COVID-19 Information &amp; Guidelines],"Hello folks of r/CoronavirusCA!

Since Governor Newsom will not be making a press conference today (it's apparently an observed holiday), I have decided to instead compile a list of guidelines and helpful information to help keep you and your loved ones safe &amp; happy celebrating this July 4th weekend. 

Information has been compiled from the Governor himself via Twitter, FB, or covid19.ca.gov as well as various *reliable* news outlets. Feel free to openly start discussions on specific county laws and ordinances. I have tried to include some pertinent ones for Santa Barbara, Ventura, Orange County, &amp; LA. I will be periodically updating this post as more information gets released.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**From Newsom's 07/02 press conference:**

[Masks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYgazUrYEiM) keep Californians healthy! [Wear One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6nTKQenOx4)! Renewed emphasis on the evidence pointing to decreased transmission rates with masks. Masks are one of the most impactful COVID-19 prevention measures. Countries that have implemented masks or have had universal mask policies in place have seen significantly less spread of COVID-19. Similar trends in other US states who have adopted masks early. 

Californians should not gather with people you do not live with. Avoid crowds. We need to temper the curve again like we did months ago. This week is **EXTREMELY** important, the Governor stresses. He wishes us all a Happy 4th of July otherwise!

""We are just trying to encourage people to be safe, thoughtful of self and others. Just because someone else is doing it, doesn't mean you should..."" He encourages people to do the right thing. Look at the hard numbers. The facts. 

**""Consider that when you are coming together with people this weekend, that one of those statistics could be YOU!""**

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**

California now has 248,235 confirmed cases of COVID-19, resulting in 6,263 deaths. The number of COVID-related deaths increased by 1.6 percent from Wednesday’s total of 6,163. The number of COVID-19 diagnostic test results in California reached a total of 4,448,176 an increase of 109,458 tests since Wednesday. The rate of positive tests over the last 14 days is 6.4 percent. California’s hospitalizations due to COVID-19 increased by 151 from Wednesday. 

82,819 new cases in last 14 days. 1,292,474 tests conducted in last 14 days. 6.4% positivity rate.

_______________________________
**Is it safe to shop at an open business?**

&amp;nbsp;

The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these state [guidelines](https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/).
________________________________
**Can I still leave the house even if I am not a essential critical infrastructure worker?**

&amp;nbsp;

Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth under [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#top)). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and comply with any other applicable public health directives.
______________________________________________
**Are gatherings permitted?**

&amp;nbsp;

State public health directives prohibit professional, social and community gatherings. Gatherings are defined as meetings or other events that bring together persons from multiple households at the same time for a shared or group experience in a single room, space, or place such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, or other indoor or outdoor space. They pose an especially high danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19.

On May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services and cultural ceremonies as well as protests. Those types of gatherings are now permitted indoors so long as they do not exceed 100 attendees or 25% of the capacity of the space in which the gathering is held, whichever is lower. State public health directives now do not prohibit in-person outdoor faith-based services or protests as long as face coverings are worn and physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. All other gatherings are prohibited until further notice, except as otherwise specifically permitted in state public health directives (including in applicable industry guidance).

Crowds and limited physical distancing increase the risk for COVID-19. If you attended a protest, remember that confidential, free testing is available. Find a [testing location near you](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/#top). If you test negative it does not mean that you may not develop COVID-19 later on. Therefore, it is advisable that you self-isolate for 14 days if possible.

Here in Canada, 80% of our deaths were in nursing homes despite banning visitors early on. It's not just to keep the elderly alive, you need to save the nursing homes otherwise the influx of residents can quickly overwhelm the hospitals. 

Staff need to be in full PPE all the time, have all residents dining in their own rooms, residents who see each other need to wear masks, isolate and test everyone at the first sign of illness, and staff need to be banned from working in multiple homes. Test all residents and staff regularly, and staff need a good sick leave policy so they can be encouraged to stay home if they don't feel well. The home I was deployed to lost 1/3 of their residents before the outbreak was contained, those people would still be alive if we adopted those measures earlier.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;




Major talking points he made:

&amp;nbsp;

12:00 pm start, 12:45 pm end

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**General**

&amp;nbsp;

Hope you all had a safe &amp; responsible holiday weekend! 

Reminders to... wear a face covering, physically distance, &amp; to wash your hands.

&amp;nbsp;

**Enforcement Prioritization**

Prioritized on parts of state with known violators, high risk work places, or industries that should be operating at a scale in an appropriate and safe manner. Extra attention given to industries that should be operating outdoors.

&amp;nbsp;

**Workplace Safety Guidelines**

**ALL** businesses required to have masks worn by staff &amp; patrons, physical distancing in place, signage on masks &amp; guidelines, occupancy limits posted.

Restaurants in impacted counties: no dining or drinking indoors, no alcoholic beverages without a meal.

&amp;nbsp;

**July 2-5 Enforcement**

~6000 visits from ABC (Alcohol Beverage) department to restaurants/bars

~444,000 contacts via visits, email, phone from Occupation Safety and Health (OSHA)

~344 licenses contacted for board of barbering &amp; cosmetology; also provided comprehensive safety checklists to businesses.

Plenty of citations from local &amp; state enforcement. Enforcement is ""tiered."" (ex.)- First violation ~$100, 2nd ~$500, final ~$1,000.



&amp;nbsp;



&amp;nbsp;

**Health and Safety**

Closed indoor operations for multiple sectors in counties on County Monitoring List (see below)

Closed all bars in these counties

Closed state beach parking lots in Southern California &amp; Bay Area for 4th of July weekend. Gov thanks residents &amp; elected officials that acted overwhelmingly responsibly. 

Launched multi-agency enforcement strike teams. 

Many counties acted at the local level: 14 issued local orders, 3 state issued orders, 6 awaiting action (Colusa, Solano, Monterey, Main, Madera, San Diego)



&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


**Positivity Rate** (**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**): 

A metric to show changes in the rates of infection. Graphs pictured show the number of positive cases in the tests conducted. An increase in the rate indicates an increase in spread of the virus.

&amp;nbsp;

24 hr: 5699 (July 5th) new cases

7 day average: 7876 (climbing) (+39%)

7 day: **7.2%**, up from ___? 1 week ago

14 day: **6.8%**, up from 4.9% 2 weeks ago

Conclusion: Significant increases in 14 and 7 day period. Finally over 7% rate.

Testing is going up (100,000 tests done over 7 days)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Hospital Capacity**

&amp;nbsp;

5790 hospitalizations 

Non-ICU Beds: 56% capacity, 41,595 are non-COVID, 5790 COVID patients. 73,867 total beds available.

ICU:  ICU went down modestly at 0.3% over 24 hours. +39% over 14 days. 1,706 COVID ICU patients, 3882 total ICU beds available. 11,058 surge aggregate ICU capacity (total max CA capacity ICU), 11,416 ventilators available.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;




&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTIONS**

&amp;nbsp;

Q1: some data released today shows that 1 business YOU owned received loans. please address. 

A1: it's in a blind trust. ask the people who run it.

&amp;nbsp;

Q2: any realistic way to open some sectors of the economy. Was there a miscalculation in speed of re-opening?

A2: I think we can safely re-open. If we wear face coverings, can reduce spread. Other countries that have enforced face masks have done well. In terms of ""how,"" with enforcement &amp; individual responsibility. laid out guidelines &amp; expectations. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q3: case # is rising, mortality is better though. What is this attributed to? How does this address the policy going forward?

A3: only 6 lives lost in last 24 hours. individual data points themselves are not a trend line; however, general trend line of deaths are lagging indicators. we are cautiously monitoring this statistic. Most important thing we learned from new data is that the cohort of individuals getting tested is getting **YOUNGER &amp; YOUNGER** (18-34 y.o.). A lot of these younger folks may be coming into hospitals but may not need as many acute needs with older populations. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q4: how is contact tracing program going? How many people deployed? What about the counties where cases are exploding and it's very hard to track?

A4: 10,600 trained at UCSF &amp; UCLA for phase 1 cohort. 9,500 directed by county health officials (bottom-up approach). Many more trained on weekly basis. Doing PSAs in culturally competent way with publicly trusted messengers. Been doing PSAs on contact tracing, particularly in communities that are anxious. Reassuring residents that info is confidential &amp; essential for health of community. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q5: about san quentin. exploding cases at prisons. conditions inhumane? they are isolated in small, low ventilation areas.

A5: been working on it every single day for 3 weeks. Top priority for administration. 2445 prisoners tested positive for COVID. San Quentin has 1308 inmates tested positive. Decompressed prison since March 1st (4051-&gt;3082). Expediting &amp; individually reviewing paroles. Have to make sure to responsibly move people out with a deep sense of urgency. In late may, prisoners were transferred to Chino to San Quentin (should not have happened in the first place) which led to spread. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q6: 4 hospitals are straining over increase in hospitalizations. For these hospitals, will we mobilize extra beds &amp; staff so we don't have to send patients hundreds of miles for care?

A6: surge plan: primarily focuses on decompressing system for non-COVID or non-elective patients who may not need urgent care, just need a hospital bed. plans to utilize existing facilities in a different way to accommodate for more capacity.

&amp;nbsp;

Q7: state is taking ramped up enforcement measures. Question specifically about orange county. OC has not issued monetary fines for citations from local enforcement level.

A7: Best left to local enforcement with *support of state.* If local officials are unwilling to enforce, state is willing to step in. Also will withhold funds from fiscal contingency plan if counties are not willing to enforce the law. If not enough of a threat, we are willing to step in with harsher enforcement and orders. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q8: 6000 businesses visited by ABC, how many cited, what were they cited, do you plan to continue?

A8: yes, continue to monitor everyday the 23 counties. stepped up enforcement efforts for the weekend. In-store/in-business visits only yielded only handful of citations. applauds the businesses, bars, and restaurants that adhered to guidelines. 52 citations, doesn't have details of citations. even if non-compliant, the engagement had them adhered to compliance quickly. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q9: about the rising cases in younger populace: what is leading to that increase? is it a cause of concern? have these outbreaks put a strain in communities where prisons are located?

A9: marin general hospital was strained; decompressing successfully into other county hospitals. ""young invincibles"" may have contributed to rise in young populace. These younger people may think they are immune or invincible to the effects of the virus. Must maintain health-conscious attitude. Someone they may come in contact with may spread the disease. About education, encouragement, and targeted enforcement.

CoronavirusCA,Noanswer_merelyapath,[Discussion] Possible methods to implement punitive measures for citizens who defy the mask mandate.,"Hello r/coronavirusCA!

Since Governor Newsom does not make addresses on Tuesday, I was hoping to start another discussion thread about whether or not we should implement punitive measures for those who disregard Gov Newsom's mask mandate from 07/01. 

&amp;nbsp;

Another user (/u/redct) in r/bayarea laid out a balanced, fair plan that warrants more attention called a ""zero-impact out"" plan. Please look below for his comment:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I don't support punitive measures unless someone's actively resisting. If someone is out in public without one, have the police officer give the person one. If the person doesn't put it on, cite them. If they get cited enough times, I think something like a large fine (or maybe points on their license if they're a CA driver) would be appropriate.

&gt;It's kind of like drunk driving: sure, it might be fine... but if it's not fine, it might end really badly for you and someone who has no idea who you are. I think the important part here is to have real, but non-criminal penalties with a **zero-impact ""out""** if you comply (wearing the free mask given to you). We obviously don't need people incarcerated over mask wearing, especially now.

&gt;That said, I'd love to see more work on the social pressure front. Through some combination of California's media and ad tech industries, I don't see why we can't invest in a state-wide campaign that's a bit more targeted than the PSA style messaging we see from governments right now. Get media and advertising experts to create high-visibility, statewide campaigns. Create messaging toolkits and campaigns that are prepackaged for local health agencies. Do takeovers of popular YouTube and Insta accounts, or create one of those self-aware government Twitter accounts. Treat it like a big product launch or movie promo. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

User /u/blackfell in /r/SantaBarbara also highlighted an important aspect called ""compliance fatigue.""

&gt;Compliance fatigue is a real thing, and we may be looking at these mandates being in place for years. Over-enforcement will just cause people to hit the 'I don't care anymore' point that much faster. Once that point's been hit, there's no turning back - containment will have failed and it'll be 'let 'er rip' time. That may end up being unavoidable if no vaccine is effective or or we start seeing mass unemployment and homelessness, but the longer we can push that back, the better the chance of getting that vaccine*.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

What are your thoughts? Should we implement a strict punitive fine or take /u/redct 's approach? How can we combat compliance fatigue? And, on a final note, who should enforce these mask bans if our police are not willing to?

Please keep discussions civil. Thanks!",1,1594149732,california,2020-07-07 15:22:12

_____________________________________________

Major talking points he made:

&amp;nbsp;

12:00 pm start, 1:02 pm end

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**General**

&amp;nbsp;

Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Physically distance. Slow the spread! 111 lives lost in last 24 hours.

We will get through this. It's not a matter of ""if,"" it's a matter of when. And that when depends on your decisions and efforts to slow the spread.

Shelter-in-place months ago was ordered to save lives &amp; prepare our healthcare systems for a larger surge.

&amp;nbsp;


**Update on Preparedness Plan in response to increases in hospitalizations**

Need to meet growing demand for hospital care by ensuring Californians who need access, receive it. Maximize capacity within current hospital settings (converting old hospitals and other facilities to decompress hospitals) &amp; in process of building additional capacity outside hospital settings.

Existing hospital footprint: 415 hospitals, but not equally distributed in the state. Roughly 21,000 licensed hospital beds in LA. In Sutter county, just have 14. Depending on where you live, capacity is very different.

On surge capacity in March vs. July: In March, we had surge capacity of ~20%, no established alternate care sites, no propositioned medical assets. We are better prepared now in July with: capability to treat 50,000 COVID patients, built alternate sites such as Sleep Train Arena, established new hospital capacity such as Seton, deployed federal medical stations.

96,000 applicants for CA Health Corps. 35,000 of those applicants for CA Health Corps had a valid license in professions needed; 741 Health Corps individuals deployed to Skilled Nursing, Corrections, &amp; other facilities. If you are retired or professionally trained, encouraged to fill out application on covid19.ca.gov. Need to match needs in different areas of the state. YOU may have a unique license, experience that may be needed in certain parts of the state.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**State Medical Supply Inventory**

In March, we had 1 million procedure masks which was wholly inadequate. Now, we have **21** million N-95 masks available. Governator years ago stockpiled N-95 masks in CA.

In 1 contract, 189 million procedure masks, 72 million N-95 masks. We were able to deliver in promises from 2 months ago to stockpile.

**DISTRIBUTED**: 201 million procedure masks, 79 million N-95 masks distributed over past 4 months.

**AVAILABLE**: 232 million procedure masks, 46 million N-95. Still in process of getting more.

So successful in procurement that we have helped to distributed these supplies to other states in need &amp; FEMA (federal emergency management).



&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Comprehensive Surge Plan presentation by person in charge of CA hospitals**:

CA hospitals continue to ramp up prep to be ready for all Californians. The numbers are increasing in CA. More people will need hospitalization and intensive care in next few weeks. 49% increase in hospitalizations in last 2 weeks, 38% increase in ICU hospitalizations. 

On Planning: Hospitals and teams have plans for surge. To be ready for any kind of emergency. 

On Preparing: Hospitals are being prepared logistically. Building up inventory of PPE. Attempting to build up capabilities of testing supplies. Cross training staff like nurses who may typically serve bed-side, how can we train them up if they are needed in ICU. Looking at every nook and cranny to increase COVID-19 capacity. 

On appreciation of staff: Thank you for the nurses, doctors, and other staff for their heroic work.

&amp;nbsp;

If hospitals work as teams, we can ensure that patients are transferred and decompressed properly and safely. 

We have therapeutic drugs like remdesivir (shortens duration of hospital stay in patients). Have learned a lot over last 4 months on how to treat COVID-19 patients.

Surge is about finding balance between caring for COVID-19 patients and caring for every other non-COVID patient in CA.

Emphasis on social distancing, masks, hand hygiene in neighborhoods and communities that help nurses, doctors, and your community. Help us expand the capacity to care for those in need.

190 individuals from HHS (federal entity) to give relief to nurses &amp; doctors. CA medical association sent trained healthcare professionals to NYC during the height of their pandemic months ago. These medical personnel came back to CA with more experience and knowledge on treating COVID-19 patients.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Health and Safety**

*Drivers of recent COVID-19 hospitalizations*: not enough people wearing masks &amp; physically distancing, increased mixing outside of households, skilled nursing facilities, prison/jail outbreaks, essential workplace outbreaks.

Younger ""invincibles"" are contributing. However, it's not just the young populace; some essential workforce &amp; older populace also contributing with poor mask compliance &amp; social distancing.

60% of the economy never shut down even with shelter-in-place order. Operational under modified orders.

18 counties issued local orders, 4 issued state, 4 awaiting action (colusa, napa, san benito, yolo)

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


**Positivity Rate** (**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**): 

A metric to show changes in the rates of infection. Graphs pictured show the number of positive cases in the tests conducted. An increase in the rate indicates an increase in spread of the virus.

&amp;nbsp;

24 hr: 11,694 (July 7th) largest single day cohort since beginning of pandemic. 8,116 7-day average. NOTE: numbers include a backlog reported from labs in LA county. this cohort would bring number below 10,000. urges citizens to look at 7-day average.

avg 106,000 tests/day, up from 2,000 tests/day @ beginning of pandemic in March.

7 day: **7.1%**, up from 6.0% 1 week ago

14 day: **7.1%**, up from 5.1% 2 weeks ago

Conclusion: COVID-19 is spreading. Goals need to re-imagined. May talk more on testing, targeting on Friday's or Monday's press conference. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Hospital Capacity**

&amp;nbsp;

6,100 new (~8%) hospitalizations, +44% over 14 day, 4240 2 weeks ago

Non-ICU Beds: 44,199 admitted (6,100 COVID), 73,867 available

ICU: 1753 ICU patients, +34% increase over 2 weeks. 3908 ICU beds immediately available. 11,313 surge aggregate ICU capacity (total max CA capacity ICU), 11,300 ventilators available.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;




&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTIONS**

&amp;nbsp;

Q1: state is sending masks to other states. clarify how many masks? what was the threshold for the mask capacity we had as a state to send to other states?

A1: when we made multiple agreements for large procurement of masks, part of agreement (esp with FEMA) was consideration of giving to those in need who need it the most. We feel connected to the ""American"" spirit and have helped our other ""brother and sister"" states. We have prioritized the needs of the state (adequately met as for now), particularly those who are working on the front line. 35 million masks to CA grocer association. Many masks in other essential sectors.

&amp;nbsp;

Q2: concerns about ""super spreaders."" can recent increase be attributed to them? Should individuals get tested even if they are asymptomatic?

A2: testing site info available at [covid19.ca.gov](https://covid19.ca.gov/). Looking to target and modify testing criteria (modified Sunday) to test most vulnerable communities and diverse areas of the state. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q3: about san quentin. are you decompressing more? are you personally going to the prison?

A3: visited San Quentin on a daily basis (including right after press conference). We've been able to decompress the prison (4051 on March 2nd -&gt; 3000 goal). 3076 right now. using chapels and gyms, and other facilities differently to try and decompress.  


&amp;nbsp;

Q4: President Trump said he will withhold federal funding from states that do not open schools. Are there repercussions for not having enough teachers to re-open? Vice President said conflicting info. Address?

A4: I'm not worried about [Trump's] latest tweets. We must **safely** open schools. It is non-negotiable. Need funding for K-12 and higher education to support efforts. Do more on face shields, gloves, gowns, masks, etc. Focus on procurement of equipment. We are providing flexibility in our statutory budget to allow for balance of in-person and online. Flexibility based on *local conditions* important as each county may be unique in class size, class environment, or accessibility. Need foundational framework to keep kids and teachers HEALTHY! I fear that more than a ""tweet."" We must protect bus drivers, children, janitors, etc. Have to make educated, data-driven decision to re-open schools. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q5: followup on education. LA times said possible delay on August 18th start of school. Is it possible to have some form of classroom instruction in 5-6 weeks?

A5: decision will be based on data &amp; where we are in a few weeks. We are not bystanders. We are agents of our own lives and decisions. local flexibility on distance learning. Acknowledges need of in-person for social/emotional development of children and teens. 


&amp;nbsp;

Q6: as testing centers are backlogged and closing, some people are waiting for a week to get tested and a week for the results. what is the point of testing if it takes so long? How many teachers, students, staff are expected to be infected with in-person?

A6: No data or modeling for school infections. We are doing ongoing work in increasing statewide tests despite supply chain concerns. We are doing record number of tests. The challenge of the time it takes to get tests back was not as much of an issue a few weeks ago. Increased fears and testing have led to backlogs in testing sites.

CoronavirusCA,bagofry,Coronavirus / Covid-19 data by Age demographics (in CA),"It's pretty interesting to look at the data broken down by age groups.

**The positive case rate is relatively similar (within a magnitude) among age groups**, between 0.26% to 0.95%. The 0-17 group is the lowest, probably either because they have a lower transmission rate, or because schools have been closed. The 18-49 is the highest, probably because they are the ones doing the most essential activities in public.

**The deaths per case is roughly 10x between each age group.** There have been 0 deaths in CA for ages 0-17 despite 22,861 cases. But for 65+, 13.7% of cases have resulted in death (1 in 7).

CoronavirusCA,Amandab805,Return to School Guidelines,"Good Morning,

I have to be vague about where I work since these guidelines have only been released to teachers, not parents or the broader public in my school district. I teach in the Central Valley, in a rural district. Basically my school district went along with parent preferences. In the letter that's being sent home to parents, my district showed what parents prefered, with no mention of what district employees answered on the survey we were given.

&amp;#x200B;

\*In person learning will take place Monday through Thursday, and Friday will be Distance Learning.  

\*Employees must wear face coverings at all times (when others are present), including the classroom (I completely agree with this). 

\*Students only have to wear masks when in the hallways outside or within 6 feet of another person. Parents in my district threatened to pull kids out of schools and homeschool if their kids had to wear facemasks. 

\* My district is the ELEMENTARY district with most of the students in K-6.

\* My school is the junior high.  We have about 500 total students (probably closer to 460). 

\*The district decided to do an am/pm schedule. The students would break into 2 cohorts. We would teach 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the afternoon. Parents choose if they want their kids in AM/PM  and siblings will be grouped in the preferred group. The survey sent home to parents gave that as a possible option. 

\*Whereas I see how this would work for the younger kids, as they are in self contained classrooms, the junior high will be a mess. I have every single student in my grade level. That's about 230 kids (kids come and go throughout the year). Now I should note that about 30% of parents stated they prefer distance learning, so my numbers will not be 230 students for in-person learning. Still, I will have to have about 150 kids per day - 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the afternoon. How many periods of my content will I have to teach? I can probably fit 12 at a time with distancing, but we'll just say I can fit 15 at a time.  That's 10 period of classes - over about 6 hours. That's a MAX of 30 minutes (with passing periods - even less). 

\*It isn't clear whether or not I will have to provide instruction to the distance learning kids. Our district is getting rid of electives (no music, art, etc.), so maybe those teachers will be covering the distance learning kids, but that would make them non-compliant with credentialing requirements, so I don't know. I am fairly certain that these teachers were still given a contract, so maybe they're going to be the distance learning teachers which is problematic because we wouldn't be compliant with credential requirements. If I am expected to provide instruction to distance learners, I will be essentially required to do extra work. It's also unclear if the cohorts in the AM (for example) will be expected to do distance learning in the PM and vice versa. If that's the case, I will be struggling with balancing in person instruction, AM/PM distance learning, and full distance learning 4 days per week. 

\*I should note that it was stated everything will probably change August 5th. That's the date we were given - maybe that's when the governor will make a final decision. So I really can't plan for anything until less than 2 weeks before school starts. I would normally have my first month of lesson plans done by that time. 

\*I am a firm believer that junior high and high school students need a different plan than elementary kids for obvious scheduling reasons. 

\*Overall I don't think hybrid will work. It should either be completely ""normal"" or completely distance learning. Subs will NOT want to come to our school if there's an outbreak. Just losing 3 teachers will completely screw with our ability to teach.

 It seems like districts are coming up with different plans in my area, and I haven't seen any from the larger districts in the Central Valley. 

Wish us luck!",9,1594307648,california,2020-07-09 11:14:08

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**General**

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you to everyone who are doing their due diligence to help mitigate the spread!

Wear a face mask! Practice hygiene and hand sanitation! Physically distance. We have lost 116 lives in the last 24 hours. 

Tulare, LA, Kings continue to be areas of disproportionate focus in regards to current trajectory of COVID-19.

&amp;nbsp;

**Fire suppression &amp; upgrades of state response to wildfires** [editor's note: Gov explains that the fire suppression efforts are connected to COVID efforts, expands below]

Blackhawk procured by CAL FIRE. +12 blackhawks in plan for next few years. Will double our fire suppression capacity. Old helicopters could not perform fire suppression at night. Will increase operational range and time.

wildfire season getting extended year in and year out. 628 fires last week in CA. It is peak wildfire season. Jan-July 5th: 4112 wildfires, significant increase over last year. Normally 280 avg/year. The good news is that the size of the fires had been contained. Average 6.6 acres, goal of 95% suppression &amp; &lt;10 acres for each fire. Been exceeding that goal. Reduction in total number of acres burned this year from wildfires despite record number of fires.

Able to navigate this year's 54.8 billion budget deficit, diverted ~150 million in equipment to fire suppression and communication. ~25 million for innovation in fire suppression efforts (Technosilva? does wildfire modeling to help with prepardness). 85.6 million for new permanent workforce in CAL FIRE, +172 full time staff (not seasonal) added to team. Regardless of your personal views on climate change, our climate is changing dramatically. Need to have new plans and flexibility to address.


PG&amp;E (nation's largest utility) is now out of bankruptcy. Coming out with new expectations, new accountability. If they don't perform, state of CA will be able to intervene in a way never done before. Vegetation management, upgrading grids, hardening infrastructure, sectionalizing grids for ideal power consumption, weather monitoring stations, IR stations all being updated and closely monitored to ensure compliance. All help to new legislature and policies allowing board of directors and advisory groups to maintain safe and compliant operation. State can take over PG&amp;E if they do not meet expectations. 

New protocols for indoor sheltering from wildfires. Ensuring shelters monitor and are able to address COVID-19 concerns. Physical distancing, masks, hygiene a highlight in these shelters. Have already utilized some of these new programs and protocols for this year's wildfires.

35 vegetation sites of high concern for wildfires. All 35 high risk areas were addressed already this year by CAL FIRE.

&amp;nbsp;

*An address from Tom Porter, Chief of CAL FIRE*:

Chief Porter extends a word of thanks to all fire suppression staff &amp; firefighters.

We are in PEAK fire season. Fires will not just go out as the sun goes down. Will burn into the night or into landscape or forest. All the new equipment, protocol, and staff allow us to contain brush fires to &lt;10 acre 95% of the time.

Requesting public's help. Cameras sometimes don't work. Please call in for fires. Report any suspicious activity. Already arrested 45 arsonists in 2020 thanks to public diligence and watch. 

Wear your mask! Keeps our emergency responders &amp; firefighters safe!

Need to put as much retardant on the ground as possible to keep fires contained. Retardant buys us time to deploy other measures to contain the fire. 

&amp;nbsp;

*An address from Director Galeducci*:

On the ability to respond to wildfires: with more complexity with COVID, need for responders &amp; public to be aware of COVID-19 concerns in event of evacuation and emergency shelter. Pay attention to local authorities, alerts/warnings. If you are told to evacuate, EVACUATE! There may be resource limitations due to budget/personnel constraints. May be sheltering individuals in hotels/motels to ensure physical distancing. If there is no shelter, temp checks, mandatory mask checks, physical distancing, feeding will all be addressed in a manner consistent with containing viral spread. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Positivity Rate** (**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**): 

A metric to show changes in the rates of infection. Graphs pictured show the number of positive cases in the tests conducted. An increase in the rate indicates an increase in spread of the virus.

&amp;nbsp;

24 hr: 7031 new cases

7 day average: 8,043 cases. 73 lives/day average lost.

7 day: **7.3%**, up from 6.0% 1 week ago

14 day: **7.3%**, up from 5.2% 2 weeks ago

Conclusion: COVID-19 is spreading. Focus on 7 day average. Keeping close eye on deaths as it is a lagging indicator.

Q1: will regular or in-mate fire crews ever be at full strength this season? How important are these inmate fire crews?

A1: 94/192 fire crews active/serviceable right now; hence, enhanced focus on strengthening fire corps with permanent, full-time staff. been actively working with CDCR to get as many firefighters trained. ~75% (150~155 crews) were active/serviceable last year. COVID might infect hand crews or firefighters and may keep them out of a fight for a quarantine period or longer.

&amp;nbsp;

Q2: how will you guarantee the health and safety of evacuating citizens? Is there a shortage of masks?

A2: Surplus of masks, looking to procure more. Inventory of over ~250 million masks (procedural + N-95). Spoke with head of CA manufacturing association last week to get manufacturing of masks in CA. For evacuation, Director Galeducci will answer.

A2(a): *Director Galeducci*: If we do congregate sheltering, shelters will be segregated appropriately, either separating positive vs. negative COVID, keeping families separate, temp checks, other medical procedures to check. Otherwise may utilize hotels/motels, CAL state university, community college, &amp; UC systems for dormitory use.

&amp;nbsp;

Q3: on decompression of prisons. status update? where are the inmates going? do you have the authority to do these early releases?

A3: top priority for our team. collaborative effort with federal receiver for healthcare needs of inmates before early release of inmates. 2,338 infections across 35 prisons (~110,000) people. were able to work aggressively with federal receiver to ensure healthcare needs and outbreaks were addressed. San Quentin is still the biggest concern. Still working to decompress the system. (4051-&gt; decompress to goal of 3000). Looking to decompress San Quentin further, expediting test results. An oversight in the decision to transfer a singular infected inmate from Chino to San Quentin led to the outbreak. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q4: please share any details of recent visit to corrections facilities.

A4: offers word of thanks to correctional facility staff. otherwise gave anecdotal or general observations &amp; offers sympathetic words to those incarcerated and their families. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q5: Any plans to visit San Quentin?

A5: been half-dozen times already. visiting prisons consistently (solano last week). reviewing early release cases with diligence to ensure safety in communities.

&amp;nbsp;

Q6: if this year's power shut offs are worse, what will happen? How can we hold utilities accountable?

A6: PSPS (advisory/safety committee that handles power shut offs in anticipation of high wind or high fire event). Was an in-person process with PG&amp;E before; now it is sectionalized to shut off selectively, not the entire neighborhood. Frequency/duration of PSPS will be lowered.


&amp;nbsp;

Q7: $4 million settlement for PG&amp;E for the ~85 lives lost. address?

A7: sorry, don't have briefing info or enough data to comment.

&amp;nbsp;

Q8: schools are re-opening? what about staff/students &amp; their concerns with PPE?

A8: schools will open when it is safe for students, teachers, bus drivers, janitors, etc. This is ""non-negotiable"". Received letter from CA association of teachers that expressed gratitude in taking a safe, data-driven approach. If we cannot safely allow kids and teachers to distance while being in classroom, we cannot open schools. $5.3 billion in budget to address learning loss, hybrid models of learning, technology, distance learning in a way that is equitable for ALL kids, not just some.

&amp;nbsp;

Q9: do we remove police from schools?

A9: many schools are lowering number of counselors and increasing policing force. Gov Newsom personally finds this curious as he believes emotional/well-being needs of teens are just as important. Task force will be created in conjunction with Superintendent of Public Education to address diverting money back to the students.

&amp;nbsp;

Q10: many haven't been able to contact EDD for their unemployment benefits. address?

A10: Few thousand have been reassigned and retrained to deal with the 6.3 million people that have filed for employment. Since Mar 15th, 44.3 billion dollars of UBI distributed to CA residents. 3.5 billion in the last week. Need to do better. Doesn't offer excuses; instead wants to modernize and update the antiquated system. Doing more with automation, texts, emails to ensure adequate communication.

CoronavirusCA,AnonymousICshopper,Hello from your Delivery Driver,"(Warning: LONG) Well hello! I am your neighbor and delivery driver (think doordash, Postmates, Shipt, instacart, etc.) I wanted to first say thank you to all of you for your business and tell you how much I enjoy delivering to you every day. This may be a 'side hustle' to some but I take pride in my work and it brings me joy to deliver your items and see your smiles. I've been driving for years and the pandemic has made this a whole new ball game, but I'm still so thankful for the job. A few things I have wanted to bring up, when you're ordering delivery:

Although I always wear my mask, please mask up too when receiving your order.

I want to make sure everyone knows that if you are unsatisfied with a driver, you can request a new one. It will cause a delay as the new driver will need time to pick up the order, but if it's necessary, you can do that. Although, be aware that if the issue is regarding the food itself, please contact the restaurant regarding that.

Many restaurants seal the bags, so if there is something you want me to double check, shoot me a text so I can ask the staff directly when I can't look in the bag. The most common issue I run into is that dipping sauces and ketchup are often not included in your order menu. If you need these things, please let me know. I know what a disappointment it is to not have enough of your favorite sauce.

There is an ""instructions"" box for delivery and I implore everyone to use it. If it's dark, or worse, there are no numbers on your home, we can have some trouble finding you. The best thing to do is put things in the box like ""lemon tree out front"" or ""red dog house in yard"". Things of that nature. If you're in a gated community, the gate code or name on the call box is much appreciated too!

Unfortunately, those of you that live in apartment complexes pose a unique challenge to us. Sometimes, there is no parking, and what's more, to enter your apartment and touch the doors, elevators, etc. puts us at a higher risk. It really is preferable for us if you meet us curb side for your items. I know that getting delivery to your door is relished, but I often risk my vehicle being towed or ticketed while I run in to deliver. With the added safety concerns of the pandemic, it's just better to meet us curb side. You receive your items faster that way, too. If you're unable to come curbside, that is ok, I know some folks do not want to leave their apartments at all (and should not if they are high risk). If you need at your door delivery, please use the delivery instruction box to guide us through the complex to your unit. Furthermore, I'm always happy to help you up if needed.

A big bone of contention I have ran into while delivering is when you order alcohol/tobacco/prescriptions. First off, you must be home to receive these items, so we can get that ID. No ""leave at door"" delivery is available.(To be clear-if the order does not contain alcohol/tobacco/or a prescription, I don't need to see you, check ID, or require you to be home. I can certainly leave the order at your door.) Some platforms require the person who placed the order to present the ID, some do not. Check with your driver if the person who placed the order is not available and if that is an issue.

We have to scan an ID to complete delivery. Every. single. time. I am seeing people who want ""no contact deliveries"" and think that they can do things like: Text photos of their license (don't do this, it's a privacy risk for you), or Leave their ID out on the porch (can't accept it, I have to see you and confirm you are the person on the ID).

There are no-contact alternatives, however! You can either stand in the window and I see you and verify your identity, or throw the door open and stand back at least 6 feet so I can see you. You are welcomed and encouraged to wear a mask while I check ID, I will not ask you to remove it. We are able to enter the ID info in manually, too, if you don't want us to touch your ID. You can make copies of the ID to leave on your porch and if we need to touch it, that may be a safer alternative than us touching the actual ID. Copies must be front and back.

**Drivers-if you're reading this- I know it may be tempting to break the rule regarding seeing the customer or not even scan ID at all, but the PD does sting operations to ensure drivers are getting ID, and doing it properly. I do not recommend taking this risk**

Finally, I want to talk a little bit about the ballot measure coming up in November, too. It was just certified for the ballot Friday. CA's AB5 is trying to reclassify us to employees and while I respect everyones' political opinions, I will bluntly tell you that this will not help drivers. Anything to the contrary is propaganda. An employee model will not work, there was already a platform that folded recently due to attempting to comply with AB5. Please vote YES on Prop 22 to protect CA App based drivers and services in November.

That's all I can think of for now! If you've got questions, comments, etc. holler at me!",1,1594450929,california,2020-07-11 03:02:09

CoronavirusCA,joyousjoyness,Great piece about kids going back to school,"This may be the best write up of the reality of the virus I’ve seen. It’s long, but a must read all the way to the end. Spot on. I'm not the author. 

Someone took a lot of time to write this and I think it’s an important and eye-opening perspective. It’s quite long, but worth sharing &amp; reading.

From Joe Morice, daughters in 8th &amp; 10th grade in our Centreville Pyramid:

To our fellow FCPS families, this is it gang, 5 days until the 2 days in school vs. 100% virtual decision. Let’s talk it out, in my traditional mammoth TL/DR form.

Like all of you, I’ve seen my feed become a flood of anxiety and faux expertise. You’ll get no presumption of expertise here. This is how I am looking at and considering this issue and the positions people have taken in my feed and in the hundred or so FCPS discussion groups that have popped up. The lead comments in quotes are taken directly from my feed and those boards. Sometimes I try to rationalize them. Sometimes I’m just punching back at the void.

Full disclosure, we initially chose the 2 days option and are now having serious reservations. As I consider the positions and arguments I see in my feed, these are where my mind goes. Of note, when I started working on this piece at 12:19 PM today the COVID death tally in the United States stood at 133,420.

“My kids want to go back to school.”

I challenge that position. I believe what the kids desire is more abstract. I believe what they want is a return to normalcy. They want their idea of yesterday. And yesterday isn’t on the menu.

“I want my child in school so they can socialize.”

This was the principle reason for our 2 days decision. As I think more on it though, what do we think ‘social’ will look like? There aren’t going to be any lunch table groups, any lockers, any recess games, any study halls, any sitting next to friends, any talking to people in the hallway, any dances. All of that is off the menu. So, when we say that we want the kids to benefit from the social experience, what are we deluding ourselves into thinking in-building socialization will actually look like in the Fall?

“My kid is going to be left behind.”

Left behind who? The entire country is grappling with the same issue, leaving all children in the same quagmire. Who exactly would they be behind? I believe the rhetorical answer to that is “They’ll be behind where they should be,” to which I’ll counter that “where they should be” is a fictional goal post that we as a society have taken as gospel because it maps to standardized tests which are used to grade schools and counties as they chase funding.

“Classrooms are safe.”

At the current distancing guidelines from FCPS middle and high schools would have no more than 12 people (teachers + students) in a classroom (I acknowledge this number may change as FCPS considers the Commonwealth’s 3 ft with a mask vs. 6 ft position, noting that FCPS is all mask regardless of the distance). For the purpose of this discussion we’ll say classes run 45 minutes.

I posed the following question to 40 people today, representing professional and management roles in corporations, government agencies, and military commands: “Would your company or command have a 12 person, 45 minute meeting in a conference room?”

100% of them said no, they would not. These are some of their answers:

“No. Until further notice we are on Zoom.”
“(Our company) doesn’t allow us in (company space).”
“Oh hell no.”
“No absolutely not.”
“Is there a percentage lower than zero?”
“Something of that size would be virtual.”

We do not even consider putting our office employees into the same situation we are contemplating putting our children into. And let’s drive this point home: there are instances here when commanding officers will not put soldiers, ACTUAL SOLDIERS, into the kind of indoor environment we’re contemplating for our children. For me this is as close to a ‘kill shot’ argument as there is in this entire debate. How do we work from home because buildings with recycled air are not safe, because we don’t trust other people to not spread the virus, and then with the same breath send our children into buildings?

“Children only die .0016 of the time.”

First, conceding we’re an increasingly morally bankrupt society, but when did we start talking about children’s lives, or anyone’s lives, like this? This how the villain in movies talks about mortality, usually 10-15 minutes before the good guy kills him.

If you’re in this camp, and I acknowledge that many, many people are, I’m asking you to consider that number from a slightly different angle.

FCPS has 189,000 children. .0016 of that is 302. 302 dead children are the Calvary Hill you’re erecting your argument on. So, let’s agree to do this: stop presenting this as a data point. If this is your argument, I challenge you to have courage equal to your conviction. Go ahead, plant a flag on the internet and say, “Only 302 children will die.” No one will. That’s the kind action on social media that gets you fired from your job. And I trust our social media enclave isn’t so careless and irresponsible with life that it would even, for even a millisecond, enter any of your minds to make such an argument.

Considered another way: You’re presented with a bag with 189,000 $1 bills. You’re told that in the bag are 302 random bills, they look and feel just like all the others, but each one of those bills will kill you. Do you take the money out of the bag?

Same argument, applied to the 12,487 teachers in FCPS (per Wikipedia), using the ‘children’s multiplier’ of .0016 (all of us understanding the adult mortality rate is higher). That’s 20 teachers. That’s the number you’re talking about. It’s very easy to sit behind a keyboard and diminish and dismiss the risk you’re advocating other people assume. Take a breath and think about that.

If you want to advocate for 2 days a week, look, I’m looking for someone to convince me. But please, for the love of God, drop things like this from your argument. Because the people I know who’ve said things like this, I know they’re better people than this. They’re good people under incredible stress who let things slip out as their frustration boils over. So, please do the right thing and move on from this, because one potential outcome is that one day, you’re going to have to stand in front of St. Peter and answer for this, and that’s not going to be conversation you enjoy.

“Hardly any kids get COVID.”

(Deep sigh) Yes, that is statistically true as of this writing. But it is a cherry-picked argument because you’re leaving out an important piece.

One can reasonably argue that, due to the school closures in March, children have had the least EXPOSURE to COVID. In other words, closing schools was the one pandemic mitigation action we took that worked. There can be no discussion of the rate of diagnosis within children without also acknowledging they were among our fastest and most quarantined people. Put another way, you cannot cite the effect without acknowledging the cause.

“The flu kills more people every year.”

(Deep sigh). First of all, no, it doesn’t. Per the CDC, United States flu deaths average 20,000 annually. COVID, when I start writing here today, has killed 133,420 in six months.

And when you mention the flu, do you mean the disease that, if you’re suspected of having it, everyone, literally everyone in the country tells you stay the f- away from other people? You mean the one where parents are pretty sure their kids have it but send them to school anyway because they have a meeting that day, the one that every year causes massive f-ing outbreaks in schools because schools are petri dishes and it causes kids to miss weeks of school and leaves them out of sports and band for a month? That one? Because you’re right - the flu kills people every year. It does, but you’re ignoring the why. It’s because there are people who are a--holes who don’t care about infecting other people. In that regard it’s a perfect comparison to COVID.

“Almost everyone recovers.”

You’re confusing “release from the hospital” and “no longer infected” with “recovered.” I’m fortunate to only know two people who have had COVID. One my age and one my dad’s age. The one my age described it as “absolute hell” and although no longer infected cannot breathe right. The one my dad’s age was in the hospital for 13 weeks, had to have a trach ring put in because she could no longer be on a ventilator, and upon finally getting home and being faced with incalculable time in rehab told my mother, “I wish I had died.”

While I’m making every effort to reach objectivity, on this particular point, you don’t know what the f- you’re talking about.

“If people get sick, they get sick.”

First, you mistyped. What you intended to say was “If OTHER people get sick, they get sick.” And shame on you.

“I’m not going to live my life in fear.”

You already live your life in fear. For your health, your family’s health, your job, your retirement, terrorists, extremists, one political party or the other being in power, the new neighbors, an unexpected home repair, the next sunrise. What you meant to say was, “I’m not prepared to add ANOTHER fear,” and I’ve got news for you: that ship has sailed. It’s too late. There are two kinds of people, and only two: those that admit they’re afraid, and those that are lying to themselves about it.

As to the fear argument, fear is the reason you wait up when your kids stay out late, it’s the reason you tell your kids not to dive in the shallow water, to look both ways before crossing the road. Fear is the respect for the wide world that we teach our children. Except in this instance, for reasons no one has been able to explain to me yet.

“FCPS leadership sucks.”

I will summarize my view of the School Board thusly: if the 12 of you aren’t getting into a room together because it represents a risk, don’t tell me it’s OK for our kids. I understand your arguments, that we need the 2 days option for parents who can’t work from home, kids who don’t have internet or computer access, kids who needs meals from the school system, kids who need extra support to learn, and most tragically for kids who are at greater risk of abuse by being home. All very serious, all very real issues, all heartbreaking. No argument.

But you must first lead by example. Because you’re failing when it comes to optics. All your meetings are online. What our children see is all of you on a Zoom telling them it’s OK for them to be exactly where you aren’t. I understand you’re not PR people, but you really should think about hiring some.

“I talked it over with my kids.”
Let’s put aside for a moment the concept of adults effectively deferring this decision to children, the same children who will continue to stuff things into a full trash can rather than change it out. Yes, those hygienic children.

Listen, my 15 year old daughter wants a sport car, which she’s not getting next year because it would be dangerous to her and to others. Those kinds of decisions are our job. We step in and decide as parents, we don’t let them expose themselves to risks because their still developing and screen addicted brains narrow their understanding of cause and effect.

We as parents and adults serve to make difficult decisions. Sometimes those are in the form of lessons, where we try to steer kids towards the right answer and are willing to let them make a mistake in the hopes of teaching better decision making the next time around. This is not one of those moments. The stakes are too high for that. This is a “the adults are talking” moment. Kids are not mature enough for this moment. That is not an attack on your child. It is a broad statement about all children. It is true of your children and it was true when we were children. We need to be doing that thinking here, and “Johnny wants to see Bobby at school” cannot be the prevailing element in the equation.

“The teachers need to do their job.”
How is it that the same society which abruptly shifted to virtual students only three months ago, and offered glowing endorsements of teachers stating, “we finally understand how difficult your job is,” has now shifted to “screw you, do your job.” There are myriad problems with that position but for the purposes of this piece let’s simply go with, “You’re not looking for a teacher, you’re looking for the babysitter you feel your property tax payment entitles you to.”

“Teachers have a greater chance to being killed by a car than they do of dying from COVID.”

(Eye roll) Per the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the U.S. see approximately 36,000 auto fatalities a year. Again, there have been 133,420 COVID deaths in the United States through 12:09 July 10, 2020. So no, they do not have a great chance of being killed in a car accident.

And, if you want to take the actual environment into consideration, the odds of a teacher being killed in a car accident in their classroom, you know, the environment we’re actually talking about, that’s right around 0%.

“If the grocery store workers can be onsite what are the teachers afraid of?”

(Deep breath) A grocery store worker, who absolutely risks exposure, has either six feet of space or a plexiglass shield between them and individual adult customers who can grasp their own mortality whose transactions can be completed in moments, in a 40,000 SF space. 

A teacher is with 11 ‘customers’ who have not an inkling what mortality is, for 45 minutes, in a 675 SF space, six times a day. 

Just stop.

“Teachers are choosing remote because they don’t want to work.”

(Deep breaths) Many teachers are opting to be remote. That is not a vacation. They’re requesting to do their job at a safer site. Just like many, many people who work in buildings with recycled air have done. And likely the building you’re not going into has a newer and better serviced air system than our schools.

Of greater interest to me is the number of teachers choosing the 100% virtual option for their children. The people who spend the most time in the buildings are the same ones electing not to send their children into those buildings. That’s something I pay attention to.

“I wasn’t prepared to be a parent 24/7” and “I just need a break.”

I truly, deeply respect that honesty. Truth be told, both arguments have crossed my mind. Pre COVID, I routinely worked from home 1 – 2 days a week. The solace was nice. When I was in the office, I had an actual office, a room with a door I could close, where I could focus. During the quarantine that hasn’t always been the case. I’ve been frustrated, I’ve been short, I’ve gone to just take a drive and get the hell away for a moment and been disgusted when one of the kids sees me and asks me to come for a ride, robbing me of those minutes of silence. You want to hear silence. I get it. I really, really do.

Here’s another version of that, admittedly extreme. What if one of our kids becomes one of the 302? What’s that silence going to sound like? What if you have one of those matted frames where you add the kid’s school picture every year? What if you don’t get to finish the pictures?

“What does your gut tell you to do?”

Shawn and I have talked ad infinitum about all of these and other points. Two days ago, at mid-discussion I said, “Stop, right now, gut answer, what is it,” and we both said, “virtual.”

A lot of the arguments I hear people making for the 2 days sound like we’re trying to talk ourselves into ignoring our instincts, they are almost exclusively, “We’re doing 2 days, but…”. There’s a fantastic book by Gavin de Becker, The Gift of Fear, which I’ll minimize for you thusly: your gut instinct is a hardwired part of your brain and you should listen to it. In the introduction he talks about elevators, and how, of all living things, humans are the only ones that would voluntarily get into a soundproof steel box with a potential predator just so they could skip a flight of stairs.

I keep thinking that the 2 days option is the soundproof steel box. I welcome, damn, beg, anyone to convince me otherwise.

At the time I started writing at 12:09 PM, 133,420 Americans had died from COVID. Upon completing this draft at 7:04 PM, that number rose to 133,940.

520 Americans died of COVID while I was working on this. In seven hours.

CoronavirusCA,skaven81,Are we crazy? Advice about safely visiting family,"My wife and I live in California (San Diego); my family lives in Texas (a very rural area 90 minutes west of Austin).  It's been over a year since I have seen my family and I really want to visit.  Over the last month or so I've been working out a plan with my family to _safely_ visit.  The plan:

* Driving instead of flying: fairly obvious.  Instead of sitting in close quarters with 160 strangers for four hours (not to mention everybody at the airport), we drive and thus have tight control over who, if anybody, we encounter along the way.
* Minimize human contact during the drive: We're going to bring a cooler with us with food and drinks, so we don't have to eat at restaurants along the way. In the few cases (notably dinners) where eating from a cooler is not going to cut it, we plan to do curbside pickup or contactless delivery to the hotel.
* Speaking of hotels, we are intentionally staying at small facilities (one in Florence, AZ, and one in Van Horn, TX).  These hotels have in-room AC (not central air) and we will wipe everything down with Lysol when we get into the room.
* Fueling stops will be at electric charging stations (not gas stations) which should already be an advantage (fewer people).  I'll wear gloves and a mask when handling the charging equipment, and use hand sanitizer once complete.
* Quarantine for both sides: we will have a full 2 weeks of self-quarantine before departing, and my family in Texas will be quarantining as well.  This ensures that we are not taking the virus with us, and that we won't catch it once we arrive.
* No additional visitors during our stay: Once we arrive in Texas, only my immediate family that has been quarantining, will be visiting.  No extra people coming over to the house to visit.
* No social events: Once in Texas, we won't be going out to restaurants or bars or anything. Just hanging out at the house and catching up.

I feel like this is more than sufficient risk avoidance to make it safe to proceed.  I'm looking for feedback, though -- am I missing any important risk vectors?  My goal is to make the trip no less risky than the types of activities we are already comfortable with and that have been deemed ""safe enough"", such as a trip to the local grocery store.",1,1594569618,california,2020-07-12 12:00:18

Major talking points he made:

&amp;nbsp;

12:00 pm start,  pm end

&amp;nbsp;


**General**

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Our approach to this crisis is to take a ""dimmer switch"" approach. Different counties and regions experience this outbreak differently. Using science and data, we believe in a dimmer switch method of controlling the outbreak, not ""shut down"" or ""open.""

&amp;nbsp;

Virus is not going away anytime soon. Until there is a vaccine or effective therapy, we will be mitigating COVID-19 sprad for the long term. Californians must adapt to new behaviors if we are to slow the spread. Weather, humidity shown to have little to no effect on the virus.

&amp;nbsp;

Additional stay at home orders: 

**ALL COUNTIES MUST CLOSE IMMEDIATELY ALL INDOOR OPERATIONS IN FOLLOWING SECTORS:** 

restaurants, wineries, tasting rooms, zoos, museums, cardrooms, bars, movie theatres

&amp;nbsp;

**All counties on monitoring list must close indoor operations for more sectors:**

fitness centers, worship services, offices for non-critical sectors, personal care services, hair salons and barbershops, malls

&amp;nbsp;

30 counties now on watchlist. ~80% of CA's population represented by these 30/59 counties. Likely to see 1-2 more counties in the next few days. 

Continuing to see hospitalizations rise; modest rise in ICU hospitalizations. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;




**Positivity Rate** (**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**): 

A metric to show changes in the rates of infection. Graphs pictured show the number of positive cases in the tests conducted. An increase in the rate indicates an increase in spread of the virus.

&amp;nbsp;

24 hr: 8358 (July 12th), 107,287 average daily tests

7 day average: 8,211

7 day: **7.7%**, up from % 1 week ago

14 day: **7.4%**, up from 6.1% 2 weeks ago

Conclusion: Virus is spreading.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Hospital Capacity**

&amp;nbsp;

+28% over 2 weeks for hospitalizations, was +50% over 2 weeks a week ago; doing slightly better. modest reduction in the growth of hospitalizations.

&amp;nbsp;

Non-ICU Beds: 6,485 (~9% of total patients are COVID), 44,577 admitted non-COVID patients. 73,867 beds available.

ICU: 1,833 admitted (~20% increase over 2 week period, last week ~39%), 16% of all ICU patients are COVID positive, 4,178 ICU beds immediately available. 11,635 surge aggregate ICU capacity (total max CA capacity ICU), 10,187 ventilators available.

In the same county outdoor sand courts are closed so when they tried to set up sand play instead they were told no by the cities.  Instead they are just playing indoors.  Is it legal for them to be playing indoors at all?  I think they are using the ""kids camp- small non- interchangeable groups of 12"" thing but it's not a camp and multiple groups use the same space during the day.",1,1594674776,california,2020-07-13 17:12:56

CoronavirusCA,Bestspacecadet2,Wine Bar wants to stay open in California operating as “food service meals” that include wine to continue outdoor operation. A little help from someone please.,"

Remember when you could serve $50 toast and get “complimentary foie gras”? That’s what my owner is trying to do at the moment. 

We are a wine bar.  Today our city sent an email to all bar owners and it says 

“We received an update today that at today's daily briefing, the Governor announced statewide required re-closure of indoor dining, indoor wineries and tasting rooms, movie theaters, indoor family entertainment centers (for example: bowling alleys, miniature golf, batting cages and arcades), indoor zoos and museums and cardrooms.  Bars, breweries, and pubs must close all operations, both indoor and outdoor. This is effective today.”

And the owner of our wine bar forwarded this email and said “We will continue our outdoor operations and put into place ""meals"" that guests will have to order. More on that at a later date, once it's figured out. Just wanted to let everyone know that we will continue to operate the way we have been, unless ordered to stop.”

He is trying to find a loophole to continue operations. I should add that yesterday, an employee who myself and two other people worked alongside just returned from international travel (Cabo/Mexico) on Saturday night and did not quarantine OR take a covid test. She claimed “I am getting tested tomorrow” which would be today. By that time, mask or not, she’s already been around us for the 8 hour shift even with social distancing. The manager on duty is scared to death of covid but she hates work and she’s lazy af, so she knew if she sent this girl home then she’d have to go work outdoors and serve people so she didn’t send her home. Now this is email came out and newsom is saying ALL bars and my employer is literally saying we will operate until told not to. 

How should I go about this? I work in the kitchen and handle the silverware. If he tried to operate with food, that will increase the amount of used silverware and plates that myself and one other person would be handling and cleaning. I have a newborn baby coming in September, I have no insurance and I’m kinda freaking out. This guy is a danger to work for at this point.",1,1594679566,california,2020-07-13 18:32:46

CoronavirusCA,ItsOk_ItsAlright,Have you noticed people not wearing masks?,"Sorry to rant but I genuinely am annoyed and want to hear your opinions please. Today alone in two different stores, I saw multiple people wearing their masks either totally under their chins or with their noses fully exposed. Regardless of how you feel about masks and whether they actually work or whatever, my frustration comes from the fact that wearing a mask isn’t optional right now. So if I’m following the rule, what makes someone else exempt? (Besides a legit medical reason)

No shirt, no shoes, no service, right? And now they’ll add “no mask”, so why is this being challenged? I find it so disrespectful to the business to walk in and then just break their new rule like it somehow doesn’t apply to me. No one likes masks. They’re hot and uncomfortable, I get it. But like...okay? It’s the rule right now. I’m not going to cry about it. I’ll wear a mask if I want to go into a store whose rule is that I must wear one. It’s as simple as that. 

I’m in Ventura county on the LA county line. It’s been very hot here, but these were all indoor stores (TJ Maxx and Pavilions market) and had the AC on blast. Employees at both places saw them and no one approached any of them. I’m sure this puts the employees in such a strange new position and it’s kinda unfair to ask them to enforce this, especially when you hear stories about employees being physically assaulted for asking a customer to wear a mask. They’re not security, nor are they paid enough to deal with that if it escalates. And I think the customers know that and know the employees are probably intimated to say something. I think that’s so arrogant and really wrong to make someone else feel that way. 

TDLR: Have you noticed people wearing masks below their chins or with their nose exposed? If it’s a rule, what makes them so special? Who are they to blatantly disrespect a store like that as if rules don’t apply to them? Or are they in the right? Is it within their right to not wear a mask the way they’re supposed to? Maybe it’s just none of my business, but I felt bad for these stores and their employees for being put in this position when times are already hard enough. What do you guys think? I’m so curious to hear others thoughts. Thanks for listening.",1,1594688465,california,2020-07-13 21:01:05

CoronavirusCA,Fritzthecheshirecat,Rant from a youth sports coach. Wear a damn mask.,"Rant from a youth sports coach in California:


Don't wear a mask. That's fine. Go to the park, walk your dog, and go home. Without a mask. You'll probably be fine, so that's all that matters... right? Fuck you. Wrong.
Are you going to the store? The Market? Liquor store? Friends house to drop off a movie or game? Are you CHECKING YOUR GODDAMN MAIL!? Wear a fucking mask. Please.
If you don't, you are directly affecting countless lives.
You're affecting MY life in the following ways, and I think you're an ASSHOLE for the following reasons, plus many:
I coach youth sports. I've been unable to coach or interact with my athletes for the past 6 months because of COVID. The school district I work at is not letting me interact
with any of my athletes because of COVID. That's fine, I can give virtual workouts and instruction, but what's the point if we can't compete as a team? I'm unable to work 
because our facilities are shut down because of COVID until things ""Clear up"". Will they ever clear up? Not if you don't wear a FUCKING MASK you ass-wipe.
I can't go to the market without being at risk of contracting YOUR illness even if you are not symptomatic. I want to work. I want to coach. I want to help these kids get into 
their 1st choice colleges and make a positive impact on humanity. I can't do that if you don't wear your mask properly.
You're affecting MY athletes lives in the following ways:
They aren't able to  compete in their regional sports championship matches. All the time spent mastering their sport is for naught and nullified. Why spend your time training for something
if it's just going to be cancelled? Not worth the risk. These students are children, but they are not idiots. They recognize basic risk/reward situations. These are
smart, talented people who are going go D1 sports schools and Ivy League academics. We are directly creating
more risk and less reward for the people who we are hoping will improve humanity and our own lives. Want to help them make your life and your kids lives better?
Wear a fucking mask, you stupid fucking neanderthal.
You're directly affecting the future of humanity by:
Taking away from their opportunities to be educated and learn valuable lessons they wouldn't learn otherwise. Things we can't teach them, things that they can only learn
through experience. We are providing them an experience of hopelessness and selfishness. How can we expect them to learn selflessness and community values
when all they know is selfish behavior that will negatively affect EVERYONE THEY INTERACT WITH?
Are these really the values we want to be teaching our children? Fuck. Should I just give up and find a new fucking career? The last 10 years of developing smart people seems 
futile when I look at the direction of the world currently. Please just wear a fucking mask and stop being entitled fucking idiots.
You aren't the only person that matters for crying out loud.

I'm currently working at a company in LA county. With Newsom's recent decision on closing most things down again, he mentions non-critical offices. Anyone know what that exactly means? 

My company is definitely not a critical business but I feel like noone is saying anything and just continuing with work. Yes, I know working and earning a salary is important right now but I honestly am scared and uncomfortable to go into the office where there are 30ish people, even though we all wear masks and have dividers.   


Our company practices really strict micromanaging so in/out times are super strict, breaks are super strict, and no work from homes are ever allowed. I don't want to get fired for asking if we can work from home or if we are going to close but at the same time, I'm really worried about my health and the risks I am taking. 

Anyone in the same boat?   


TLDR; super strict and micromanaging company continues to open office and gives employees no communication in regards to newsom's latest order - I am scared/uncomfortable to go into the office but have no choice.",5,1594798654,california,2020-07-15 03:37:34

I live and work in a very conservative area. I, however, am not conservative.  Sometimes I feel sort of alone in that. I understand just how frustrating this pandemic and Newsom's response must be for business owners and others who are struggling. A lot of the Facebook and Nextdoor posts that I see are announcing to people where recall petitions are located.  I see a lot of feedback for these posts.  A LOT of people want to sign them and are asking for their own petitions to display in their own businesses. Although I do not think Newsom made EVERY right decision in dealing with COVID (It would be impossible to do so), I don't know that he should be recalled. I do consider myself very lucky in that I am still getting paid and my family hasn't faced any financial difficulty. I try to put myself in the shoes of others, but I think people are blaming the wrong person. Where is the personal responsibility? It just makes me nervous.

There are a couple of lawsuits already challenging the unconstitutional nature. I am also looking to see if I can file a lawsuit and/or class action with fellow impacted landlords. Landlords are used to doing things by the book, in court, rather than speaking to the media or government bodies, but it’s crucial that they do so now. **Email:** [judicialcouncil@jud.ca.gov](mailto:judicialcouncil@jud.ca.gov)

CoronavirusCA,robyn28,Close the Borders!,"According to the California data from worldometers.info, the curves for the new daily cases and new daily deaths have been on a roughly straight line increase since late March, early April. It appears that anything that Newsome has ordered has had no impact on bending these curves. It appears that opening and closing businesses, wearing masks, social distancing, working from home, or closing beaches haven’t had any major impact statewide.

Many countries in Europe are now relaxing or removing restrictions and opening their schools. To effectively control COVID-19, many countries closed their borders. 

Why hasn’t California shut it’s borders and ports of entry? Several decades ago, California had Agricultural Inspection StatIons on major highways coming into the state. Vehicles were stopped and checked for fruits and vegetables to protect the state’s agricultural products from destructive bugs and insects. 

Closing the borders would stop out-of-state infections.  Other states have closed their borders for periods of time. Why can’t California do the same? We’ve been in lockdown for over three months now. There should be enough data from the counties to determine exactly why cases and deaths curves aren’t flattening out. 

I fear that as long as California bounces back and forth opening and closing businesses, wearing/not wearing masks the new cases and new deaths will continue to increase until a vaccine is widely available.",4,1595112735,california,2020-07-18 18:52:15

As the title reads, someone at my job has unfortunately gotten the virus. My store manager told (almost)  everyone on Friday and that's about it. 

Her department is connected to mine. I habent seen her in aboit 2 weeks or more, however. She works a morning shift and I work random shifts. But another girl in her department (pregnant btw) never wears her mask correctly: it is always on her chin. And she is their department manager so they have definitely came into co tact with each other.

So all that is supposedly suppose to happen is a ""deep clean"" of the store (overnight). But NOTHING has happened.

My union UFCW LOCAL 700 has been MIA since the beginning of the pandemic. We dont even have a union rep at my store location so all of our issues with the Kroger company go absolutely nowhere!

I want to quit but I have to move before 2021. I live with my elderly aunt as well. Also my GF works at my job too. 

They do not adhere to having the customers wait outside in a line. They dont care how busy it gets. What should we do?

_____________________________________________
*12:00 pm start, 12:43 pm end*

Major talking points he made:

&amp;nbsp;

**General**

&amp;nbsp;

*It's our decisions, not our condition, that determines our future.*

Recognize what is self-evident. Our decisions will determine our fate and future in regards to the virus. Our actions that determine when our children go back to school. Our actions determine how we can connect with family &amp; friends. 

Wear a face mask! Evidence in other countries is increasingly apparent for reducing risk of COVID-19 transmission. Airflow &amp; taking activities outside can help reduce risk. 

Be 6' apart from people not in your household. We have to minimize our mixing to prevent the spread of the disease.

&amp;nbsp;

Clarification on personal care services: intention for barbershops and personal care shops to operate outside. Updated guidelines have been released on covid19.ca.gov in regards to personal care shops. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Positivity Rate** (**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**): 

A metric to show changes in the rates of infection. Graphs pictured show the number of positive cases in the tests conducted. An increase in the rate indicates an increase in spread of the virus.

&amp;nbsp;

24 hr: 6,846 (July 19)

7 day average: 8,911, ~120,000k tests average

7 day: **7.2%**, down from 7.7% 1 week ago

14 day: **7.4%**, same as from 7.4% 2 weeks ago

Conclusion: Growth is decreasing; however, virus is still spreading with &gt;7% positivity rate. We cannot be satisfied. Numbers can change quickly depending on *YOUR* personal decisions everyday. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Hospital Capacity**

&amp;nbsp;

Non-ICU Beds: 6,921 (~9% of patients are COVID positive). +16% over 14 days (2 weeks ago was +50%, last week Mon was +28%, growth is therefore decreasing). 43,692 (59% of patients are non-COVID). 73,867 beds available. 

ICU:  1,963 (~17% of patients COVID, +12% increase over 14 days). 4,057 ICU beds immediately available. 11,637 surge aggregate ICU capacity (total max CA capacity ICU), 11,932 ventilators available.

County needs are different. For example, San Benito is at 100% ICU capacity. Surge program established months prior helps to decompress stretched hospitals and staff. ~190 individuals came from federal HHS to help relieve some stresses on staffing. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTIONS**

&amp;nbsp;

Q1: Trump is interested in sending federal troops in Oakland. Any comments?

A1: No, we rejected it.

&amp;nbsp;

Q2: in re: schools. is it better for schools on watchlist counties to just remain closed even if they are removed from watchlist for 14 days? what about availability of testing when schools are open?

A2: will continue to provide all forms of PPE to all schools on a as-needed basis. Have cohorts of testing planned to ensure virus doesn't spread quickly in at-risk communities. more capacity in labs and universities to expand testing. CDC finally came through with testing strategy that allows more individuals to be tested, pulls samples together and will open up more opportunities for testing. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q3: NY Times reported that you were told to personally thank Trump for federal aid. Was that the first time you have been requested to do such a thing? Was it an appropriate request?

A3: Was it true? No, it was not true. No one asked Newsom. He expressed gratitude for the swabs provided. Newsom is willing to express gratitude to anyone who helps this state. We need a national strategy; testing in state at a national level. More efforts to trace &amp; quarantine cases.

&amp;nbsp;

Q4: at least 15 contact tracers for every 100k residents required before re-opening; at least 17 counties did not meet threshold. Why did you let them open? Will you treat the threshold differently in the future when they want to re-open?

A4: *Dr. Ghaley's reply*: When attestations were rolled out, asked counties to demonstrate multiple things including contact tracers (15/100k). Each county did that but were not required to have them. We had lower number of cases reported statewide back then and it was a chance for each county to prepare for another spread with contact tracers. The counties that did not have 15/100k at least had a plan in place to implement tracers. 

A4(a): *Gov Newsom's reply*: New platform to train another cohort of tracers (partnered with UCSF and UCLA). ~10,000 tracers trained last month being distributed around the state. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q5: lawmakers asked to scale back legislative bills while administration is busy with COVID-19. comments?

A5: preparing for wildfires, got PG&amp;E out of bankruptcy, balancing large 2020 budget deficit. NOFA (600 million) for homelessness in CA. We have capacity to do many things. Will be sorting bills via what is most important. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q6: in re: wait time to get results. some places report having to wait 13-14 days for results. comments?

A6: over 100 days ago, only 2000 tests a day. Now, over 124k tests a day. puts strain on the system, especially on a national level as other states are aggressively testing. testing delays are very significant and impactful, especially for skilled nursing homes, etc.

A6(a): *Dr. Ghaley's reply*: tier 1 testing in hospitals have very quick testing. other tests in other settings where turnaround time is quite long. we are focusing on matching collection sites with testing sites that can process them quickly. exploring sending samples to different testing sites. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q7: where does the responsibility lie for this outbreak? is it on government for not having enough tracers and tests? Is it on the individual citizen?

A7: we were successful early on. Models are iterative. we are preparing for worst-case scenarios- always have been from the beginning of the pandemic. procured millions of masks and PPE; distributed an unprecedented amount. Acknowledged need for more testing and contact tracers. Initially predicted ~3,600 new cases a day. Newsom takes responsibility as it is his state. His people. His job is to bring people together and hold them all to a higher level of accountability. It wasn't about the state. It's about a state of mind. That's why we were so successful in the beginning phases of the pandemic. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q8: in re: outdoor vs. indoor schools. comments?

A8: not in guidelines specifically but based on evidence and local health officials, Newsom may be open to outdoor schooling.

CoronavirusCA,tayhdoe,COVID + Chlamydia Pneumoniae (Cpn),"Hi all,

30y/o male here. Back in December 2019 I started having pain in my lungs and it was hard for me to breathe. I went to my doctor and found that I tested positive for Chlamydia Pneumoniae (Cpn). Doc gave me Azithromycin (Z-Pak) which seemed to help for a bit.

Then a month later, late January, my symptoms came back and were slightly worse. Doc gave me another round of Z-Pak. Seemed to help again until early March when I started to experience lung pain and phlegm 10 times worse than before. I was sleeping on ice packs just to fall asleep. COVID was NOT a thing yet in America so Doc put me on Z-Pak again. Nor was I tested. Symptoms get better then in late May symptoms get worse than ever before. I was coughing up the most mucus I have ever produced in my life. Phlegm filling my lungs. Horrible pain.

Doc tests me for COVID antibodies and I test positive for IgG. Doc thinks current infection is due to the Chlamydia Pneumoniae not COVID. 2 months later I am now on TWO different antibiotics to try and quell the infection. Now when I go off the medication, symptoms come back almost immediately.

Recently I have found studies linking Chlamydia Pneumoniae caused by COVID. See below for an article I found **linking fatailty rate with COVID + Chlamydia Pneumoniae. This maybe why Azithromycin is working...**

_____________________________________________
*12:01 pm start, 12:59 pm end*

Major talking points he made:

&amp;nbsp;

**General**

&amp;nbsp;

[editor's note]: conference was held at one of the warehouses used to store and distribute medical supplies and other PPE.

We were able to bend the curve many months ago. This gave us time to procure an excess supply of PPE and to implement surge capacity protocols. Bending the curve worked! We are well-prepared to deal with any surges in hospitalizations. Newsom thanks the people of CA for the seriousness of their purpose, for the recognition of the seriousness of the virus. He knows that we can bend the curve again; but only with *YOUR* behavior. Thanks all Californians who have been role models and take part in responsibly re-opening our state and schools. 

46 million masks per month being used (referred to as a burn rate) in state of CA. PPE plan was implemented due to a lack of a federal plan. Since we had to bid against federal for PPE, CA moved to a more resourceful approach. Contracts with multiple companies like BYD helped us secure 193 out of the 200 million of the purchased masks. 146 million N-85 procured so far, 150 million more in next few weeks. 297 million procedure masks &amp; 85.5 million N-95 distributed into essential sectors. Inventory of 147 million procedure &amp; 111 million N-95 currently across CA. Still not adequate enough; made bridge contract with BYD for additional 300 million procedure, 120 million N-95 masks. 

CA has distributed over 17 million masks to neighboring states. NV, OR, AK, AZ have expressed needs with problems of low supply vs. high demand. CA is well prepared in regards to PPE compared to most, if not all other states. 

RFP (response for proposals) in effort to bid for competitive mask and PPE prices. Anticipate more competitive prices by Fall/Winter by CA-based PPE manufacturers. Personal conversations with CEO of Honeywell to establish CA-based N-95 manufacturing plants. Other companies (3M, BYD) also involved in CMTA partnership to provide CA with competitive prices for PPE. 

Personally thanks warehouse workers. Some have worked since 3-4 administrations prior and have extensive experience in helping move PPE up and down the state. 

Highlights some problems in delivery and accountability in handing out PPE. Some front-line nurses are only getting 2-3 masks/week and Newsom acknowledges this is unacceptable. Will work hard on addressing issues in transparency and accountability in order to properly deliver PPE to those who need it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Today we are reporting the 127k tests conducted yesterday. Cohort tested was slightly in excess compared to average. 12,807 reported positive yesterday. 115 deaths. ~400k+ positive cases in CA since beginning of pandemic. 

35,000 health corp qualified applicants are being distributed to help decompress staff and hospital shortages. 

&amp;nbsp;

Stepped up efforts for PSAs for masks that target populace in a more culturally competent way. Highlights again the importance of protecting our teachers, students, and essential school workers (bus drivers, cafeteria, etc). 

&amp;nbsp;

New efforts to continue moving indoor activities outside. Applauds president for wearing a mask. Hopes that it will help reduce spread and transmission. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Positivity Rate** (**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**): 

A metric to show changes in the rates of infection. Graphs pictured show the number of positive cases in the tests conducted. An increase in the rate indicates an increase in spread of the virus.

&amp;nbsp;

24 hr: 12,807

7 day average: 90 lives average lost/week. 9,420 positive cases/week

7 day: **7.6%**, down from 7.7% 1 week ago

14 day: **7.4%**, same as from 7.4% 2 weeks ago

Conclusion: growth has slowed but virus is still spreading at &gt;7%. 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Hospital Capacity**

&amp;nbsp;

Non-ICU Beds: no comments

ICU: ____ ICU beds immediately available.  surge aggregate ICU capacity (total max CA capacity ICU),  ventilators available.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTIONS**

&amp;nbsp;

Q1: oakland mayor concerned about eviction moratorium expiring soon. will you extend? address?

A1: looking beyond that. there is wisdom in mayor's comments; however, increasing conscious nationally is important. Walking towards edge of cliff. A lot of the work we did in regards to CARES act and stimulus were temporary in nature. the PUA ($600/week) is an example. Yes, we are working very closely with legislature to extend. Looking using his power to extend his emergency executive orders. looking at sick leave, protecting essential workers, etc. as there is a disproportionate spread in 4 areas: hospital, essential workers, congregate settings (shelters, etc), &amp; prisons. also disproportionate spread among ethnicities; latino population hit hardest. 600 million NOFA agreement to deal with homelessness; housing and supportive services with partnerships with hotels/motels.

&amp;nbsp;

Q2: in re: education. advice to parents that struggle with distance learning? especially for child care for families that are in essential sectors?

A2: must avail more child care opportunities for essential workers. acknowledges there is more work needed to do. a lot of guidelines and educational materials released for patients and educators. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q3: 5-7 days for results for tests from Quest Diagnostics. are you rethinking contracts or partnerships? any plans to get results faster?

A3: re-constituted task force last week with Dr. Ghaley. utterly meaningless to get results 13-14 days after test. all of this is in absence of a national testing plan. need more tests, more repetition, and stronger criteria for expedited vs. normal tests. Dr. Ghaley is also looking to use contact tracers more effectively.

A3(a): *Dr. Ghaley's reply*: Quest was one of the first national labs Ghaley reached out to. 2 weeks ago had conversation with senior leaders about issue of long test turnaround. some are 24-48 hrs, others are average 7-8 days. it's not about collecting, it's about testing in a lab. CA's current challenge is to have test results matched with a collection site that can give speedy, meaningful results. 


&amp;nbsp;

Q4: thousands of parents are joining FB groups that are looking to provide children with online tutors in groups. address?

A4: 100,000 new Wi-Fi spots. 10s of thousands of chromebooks, other devices. Dr. Linda Hammond estimates that the digital divide has been addressed by about 50%. Issue of equity is #1 priority. Supplementing students with most needs (disabilities, homelessness, ESL, etc.). in re: FB groups, Newsom is very encouraged. Exactly what we need. Community needs to step in to help educate our youth.

&amp;nbsp;

Q5: nurses not getting adequate PPE. Why sending masks to other states if our own hospitals don't have them?

A5: 86 million N-95 &amp; 111 million procedure masks in inventory today. We developed a partnership with FEMA (pays 75% of all PPE procured) and Bob Fenton for Western Alliance for procurement of PPE to ensure that states are not competing against each other. We were in a position to help American citizens, not just Californians. We helped them as promised months ago. Issue about supply mismatch is about distribution and local accountability, not supply deficit. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q6: clarify ICU bed capacity? CDC vs. State numbers on website have inconsistencies. address with numbers?

A6: we do that on a consistent basis (last did on Mon). don't have slide presentation today as we are in a warehouse. ~17% of current ICU &amp; NICU beds in system occupied by COVID-19 positive patients. numbers are only 48 hours old.

CoronavirusCA,nfz21,CA private high school finding a way to reopen despite gov orders,"I'm going to keep this vague for a lot of reasons.

I am in a county that has been on the watchlist for a while with no end in sight. After the governor's orders came out about schools last week, I made sure to see if it applies to private schools as well. As it does, I expected this private high school to be closed at the beginning of the year.

Turns out they are trying everything they can to reopen, even talking to lawyers. The teachers are split, but most of them are not in favor, and a lot are asking about their own kids and what they're supposed to do. I know this is a common thread everywhere.

Can the school just decide to NOT adhere to the governor's orders? I know typically the government doesn't have a ton of control over what a private school does, but is this situation different?

EDIT: After closely looking at the documents, I guess it doesn't say anywhere that it's mandatory, it's just ""guidance""... So I guess the school is welcome to ignore everything. ",13,1595461909,california,2020-07-22 19:51:49

_____________________________________________
*12:02 pm start, 12:58 pm end*

Major talking points he made:

&amp;nbsp;

**General**

&amp;nbsp;

Certain populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Multi-generational households are particularly vulnerable. Challenges in congregate facilities (homeless shelters, skilled nursing, correction institutions, etc.). 

&amp;nbsp;

Reinforcement of the importance on personal responsibility to wear face masks, physically distance, and practice good hand hygiene. It's very easy to forget that our intentions may be 100% to stop spread; however, our careless moments may reduce our actual complaint behavior to 90%. When you go to the breakroom and briefly take your mask off and forget to put it back on, it may expose you or your co-workers to the virus. 

&amp;nbsp;
________________

**Stopping the spread of COVID-19 depends on our ability to keep our essential workers safe.**

Not enough emphasis placed on essential workers in state. Newsom proceeds to show a slide of the race/ethnicity breakdown of frontline essential workers. Overwhelming majority of our essential sectors are made up of Latino, Asian, and Black populations. Particularly farm, construction, cook, and food preparation workers are from Latino populations. This essential workforce remains the backbone for providing fundamental services in CA.

&amp;nbsp;

**New worker safeguards**: preventative measures, employer education, and long lasting worker protections.

&amp;nbsp;

*Preventative Measures*: Ensure workers can isolate and quarantine when sick or exposed. Provide safe, temporary housing for COVID positive and exposed agriculture and farmworkers. Administration looking at Project Roomkey and extending its model to workers who need to isolate or quarantine in motels/hotels. 626k cropworkers live and work year-round in CA. Housing and farmwork partnerships in place in Monterey to house and support agricultural workers to isolate and quarantine when exposed/sick. Build on PSAs to reach employers, workers, and families to educate about guidelines and worker's/citizen's rights. When we re-opened CA, we focused too much on ""when"" and not ""how."" We have responsibility to do more on ""how"" to safely re-open.

*Employer Education*: New handbooks released for employers to understand guidelines in an easier manner. More info on guidance for safe, clean environments, best practices for an outbreak, proactive education efforts to help businesses comply, &amp; testing information for employees.

*Ensuring long lasting protections*: worked to expand worker protections and build on existing Executive Orders including: COVID-19 paid sick leave, worker's comp for at risk workers, strategic enforcement of labor laws, and strengthening employer reporting of outbreaks. We do not want sick workers forced to work and infect others. Don't want to implement punitive measures as primary enforcement method; compliance is the answer. If there are repeat or serious offenders, punitive measures will be considered. No previous requirement for business to contact local health officer if an employee tested positive. New requirements for businesses to report employee cases.

_________________

&amp;nbsp;

**Positivity Rate** (**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**): 

A metric to show changes in the rates of infection. Graphs pictured show the number of positive cases in the tests conducted. An increase in the rate indicates an increase in spread of the virus.

&amp;nbsp;

24 hr: 9,718 (July 23), ~137k+ tested yesterday. Pooled testing approved by CDC &amp; FDA to allow for ""batch"" testing, speeding up the process it takes to test larger populations. Multiple samples will be ""pooled"" and tested as a congregate sample. If the sample tests positive, each individual sample will be retested. 

7 day average: 9,881, ~124k average tests daily over last 7 days.

7 day: **7.9%**, up from 7.7% 1 week ago

14 day: **7.5%**, up from 7.4% 2 weeks ago

Conclusion: growth is slightly increasing again.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Hospital Capacity**

&amp;nbsp;

Non-ICU Beds: 6,952 (+9% increase over 14 days), rate of growth beginning to decline modestly in Non-ICU hospitalizations. ~9% of non-ICU patients are COVID positive.

ICU: 2,002 COVID positive (+11% increase over 14 days, ~23% of total ICU (non-surge) beds occupied). 2,614 ICU beds immediately available. 8,894 surge aggregate ICU capacity (total max CA capacity ICU), 11,932 ventilators available.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTIONS**

&amp;nbsp;

Q1: in re: stanislaus &amp; san benito county. 130% hospital capacity in stanislaus. how many health care clinicians are ready to deployed to hospitals now?

A1: don't have exact number right now. ~35k of the CA Health Corps available, hundreds have already been deployed. 190 federal HHS medical personnel deployed last week and this week. Other multi-jurisdictional strike teams and federal health workers being assembled for deployment. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q2: struggles with EDD benefits. address? Is it state's responsibility to help people forced out of work if federal does not provide?

A2: have implemented numerous creative solutions (plates campaign, project homekey, etc) to help those in need. confident that House Speaker Pelosi will pull something off that is ""important"" to get ""checks in the pockets of those impacted by COVID-19."" 14 billion distributed in EDD this week. no other state comes close in terms of processing; however, this is not an excuse. ~18k people implemented to help with call centers and support for EDD and other benefits. IT infrastructure problems as the foundation system is from 1979. Need to update; opportunity to update with COVID-19. Can re-imagine the entire process and system. working with leadership in Senate and Assembly to address issues of eviction. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q3: in re: transmission rates in counties like LA. why was LA chosen to receive military hospital aid?

A3(a): *Dr. Ghaley's (head of HHS) reply*: don't live in aggregate. Some counties are below 1.0% transmission rate. Imperial &amp; LA are both below 1.0%. Others hovering around 1-1.3%. That means that over time, more people will be infected. Some counties are on the upward trend of transmission. We are monitoring closely to make sure that hotspots have adequate PPE and health officials to ensure numbers start to trend downwards. Dept of Defense staffing and support provided for important areas of disease transmission. 


&amp;nbsp;

Q4: LA times said that health inspectors were sent to skilled nursing facilities without being tested first. address?

A4: already changed protocols. health inspectors are tested prior to entering and assessing high risk areas.

&amp;nbsp;

Q5: are you signing any executive orders or public health orders today? Any waivers for schools? Union support for waivers?

A5: waiver process is for elementary schools only. School districts to work with local public departments to offer in-person instruction in counties on the County Monitoring List. School and district leaders must initiate the request for the waiver in consultation with labor, parents, and community-based organizations. California provided the waiver because younger students are at a lower risk to be vectors of COVID-19 and because earlier return allows them to benefit from in-person instruction. Legislation is in session; thus executive orders or other public health orders can be advanced in real time. working hard to present updates and additions to Executive orders for *next week*.

&amp;nbsp;

Q6: in re: federal benefits expiring. At best, still going to be a gap in services. what does this mean day-to-day? Any relief in the interim? $600 in Iowa is very different than $600 in CA. address?

A6: made case to Pelosi and other leaders months ago for new CARES act. have been very critical of the US senate that moved very slowly. have great expectations at House level due to Pelosi's competency at moving and enacting bills. our budget has been adjusted to address 100 million to ITC (working families). compared to other states, our state-level support for minorities, homeless, essential workers is much better and progressive.

Major talking points he made: [editor's note: today's conference was held in Stockton, typical slides for hospitality &amp; positivity rate may or may not be shown]

&amp;nbsp;

**General**

&amp;nbsp;

Stresses importance of protecting essential workers in CA. While we see positivity rate in CA growing modestly, not happening evenly across the state. Certain counties &amp; sectors are disproportionately impacted by the transmission of the virus. 8 counties in Central Valley R_effective_rate &gt;1.0%. Congregate settings (correctional, skilled nursing, etc), essential worker sector, &amp; latino populations particularly disproportionately affected. 

$52 million (part of $499 million CDC grant through federal gov't) invested into Central Valley &amp; the 8 counties in question to enhance health care, staffing, &amp; testing. 3 strike teams deployed to Central Valley (OEMS, OSHA, Dept of Social Services, etc.), similar to the strike team deployed to Imperial County weeks ago. 

On Stockton: county is struggling with increase in rates of transmission. Challenges in staffing in hospitals, increases in ICU cases. Thanks Mayor Tubbs &amp; the city for doing a great job. 5/8 federal gov't medical teams deployed to Central Valley, 1 of which was deployed to Stockton.

&amp;nbsp;

**Positivity Rate** (**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**): 

A metric to show changes in the rates of infection. Graphs pictured show the number of positive cases in the tests conducted. An increase in the rate indicates an increase in spread of the virus.

&amp;nbsp;

24 hr: 6,891 (+1.5% increase) out of 128,439 tests reported.

7 day average: 9,859; 109 deaths avg/week

7 day: **7.8%**, up from 7.7% 1 week ago

14 day: **7.5%**, up from 7.4% 2 weeks ago

Conclusion: infection &amp; transmission growing.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Hospital Capacity** 

&amp;nbsp;

Non-ICU Beds: +3% increase compared to +50% 2 weeks ago, decline in the rate of growth.

ICU: +7% increase compared to +39% 2 weeks ago

CoronavirusCA,Zorgi23,"COVID Update - July 27, 2020: A new cognitive test"," 

https://preview.redd.it/blpuio9zxgd51.jpg?width=490&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e1751a1b916ce1a7c1a3a8b4b01ddc9e793c2be

Since last week was the week to [boast about cognitive tests,](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/politics/donald-trump-cognitive-test-montreal-mental-health/index.html) I thought I’d post one of my own. What’s the difference between Scene 1, Scene 2, and Scene 3, all images from this weekend?

Look closely now. . . oh, there it is. In Scene 3, everyone is wearing a mask. In Scenes 1 and 2, no one is wearing a mask. #1 is from a religious concert held on Cardiff beach, a few miles from where I live, to defy Newsom’s ban on indoor services. #2 is from inside John MacArthur’s Grace Community Church in L.A.. Scene 3 is from a BLM protest at the LA Federal Building.

Some people are constantly using the argument, “But what about the BLM protesters? Why don’t you blame them, you hypocrite?” This is why. And that photo is typical of every photo I’ve seen of the protests. The biggest danger of getting COVID is generally from the police, who don’t wear masks and who spray tear gas on everyone, thus increasing their risk.

This is why the National Bureau of Economic Research, in a paper examining this issue in detail, concluded BLM protests did not contribute to the surge in COVID cases in any meaningful way. Scientific American came to the [same conclusion](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-evaluate-coronavirus-risks-from-black-lives-matter-protests/).

Here’s a follow-up question to the one above: which scene is more dangerous, #1 or #2? In both events, people were in close proximity to each other; in both, they’re talking, shouting, and singing. Singing may be one of the [most dangerous activities.](https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article242990591.html)

To answer this question, it might be helpful to learn from an expert in aerosols. Professor Kimberly Prather, Distinguished Chair in Atmospheric Chemistry at UCSD, has been studying aerosols for decades. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU8Hf_5-oLc) explains why inside gatherings are so much more dangerous than outside ones. So there’s the answer: the gathering on the Cardiff beach wasn’t a good thing, because of the close proximity of the people and their refusal to wear masks. But the inside gathering at Grace Community Church is an direct invitation to COVID to come and infect people. It’s too bad that church can’t be charged for every dime in medical costs incurred by the people who get sick from it.

Unfortunately, science denial and conspiracy theories have been a part of every pandemic since the Black Death in Europe. In the 14th century, ignorant people blamed Jewish people on the plague. During the 1918 pandemic, they blamed Germany, claiming that country had developed the flu as a weapon, even though epidemiologists are almost certain it originated in Kansas.

The difference it that social media today gives these people a worldwide, instantaneous platform, and the owners of social media platforms, particularly Facebook, Twitter, and NextDoor, have clung to the idea that everyone should have a say. In practice, trolls take over social media platforms, and they become havens for the most backward and conspiratorial people.

I thought of all this while I was loading the county data and saw the Zorgi Scores at the end:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6unlwu01ygd51.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce83053afa65b8d9a1f206a5a51c3301faf0b639

What in the world happened to Kern County?

First, a bit of personal history. Back a few months ago, I was only covering San Diego County and I was thinking of covering a few more counties. I asked my readers which ones I should include. Of course, LA and Orange were shoo-ins, but a lot of people argued that I should include Kern.

Why? Because of the infamous two Bakersfield doctors, Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi, who came out with a viral video claiming COVID-19 was no big deal. This video was promoted all over NextDoor, Facebook, Twitter, etc. It got 4.3 million views on YouTube. Elon Musk, anxious to reopen his Fremont Tesla plant, praised the duo. They became Fox News heroes. No matter that their “science” was [actually garbage](https://calmatters.org/health/2020/04/debunking-bakersfield-doctors-covid-spread-conclusions/).

But Kern County is interesting for another reason. Kern is a Republican stronghold. 53% voted for Trump. Kevin McCarthy is the Representative for the 23rd District. He’s a Trump supporter through and through.

Kern is also 55% Latinx. The median value of owner occupied homes is $205,000, not enough to buy a Porta-Potty in LA or San Diego. The median household income is just over $52K. Kern also has over 10,000 permanent farmworkers and almost 20,000 at the height of the season.

In other words, Kern is kind of like many counties in swing states: Trump loyalists in control, but populated by lower middle class workers who are very likely to be deemed “essential” workers. Along with that, there are people like the doctor duo all over the place – people who ostensibly represent “science” but in fact spread disinformation.

The important thing is that what’s happening in Kern might happen next in the swing states, and that doesn’t bode well for Trump. Let’s see why Kern has such a high Zorgi Score.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/huoay472ygd51.jpg?width=1215&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a46c961ce71a113e482307ddad7d944359ba4cd2

I actually had to modify the Zorgi Score calculation because of Kern. Originally, the percentage increase was one of the multipliers, but it never went over 300% or 400%. But with an 1172% increase, Kern was ending up with a Zorgi Score over 30! So I changed it so the maximum a county could get for daily case changes was 7 points.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qajc8x83ygd51.jpg?width=1009&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a84abe8e9dfd7b2b5a1c3769ebe66f3ff441b6cf

Over the past month, cases have gone from just over 4,000 to almost 17,000, a 300% increase. Daily cases jumped from under 100 to over 1,000 a day. The scary thing is that case doubling days have dropped from 28 days to just 8 days. Think of that: every week, Kern is almost doubling its case count. While that won’t keep up for long, it’s a sobering reality now.

Daily fatalities, while still low in absolute terms, have increased by 80%, and now 3 people a day are dying there.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ys03veg4ygd51.jpg?width=899&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=807a52d44bee4d014bc18a7470efc4c3d2c9670f

While daily hospitalizations have decreased a bit, daily ICU has not. It has risen by over 50%, and the IUR is now also over 50%. This is concerning because Kern, like a lot of more rural counties, has much less access to medical care than one would find in LA or SD.

It appears that this phenomenon, i.e. COVID-19 overrunning Republican strongholds, is why Trump [changed his tune](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-masks.html) on wearing masks as well as the seriousness of the pandemic. This isn’t an embrace of science or anything of the sort by Trump; it’s pure political calculation. [COVID is hurting his campaign](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/07/17/trumps-campaign-is-in-freefall-with-covid-19-on-voters-minds/), and that’s all he cares about.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A quick review of some of the other data.

Have cases plateaued in the US? There are some signs that they may have:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ymri1po5ygd51.jpg?width=741&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2cf3f194226350e03f90ff7e0569ef2ba57b262

However, it’s still a bit early to jump to that conclusion. Also, note that doubling days are now down to 42. If we’re adding more than 60,000 cases a day, doubling that in less than a month and a half is not a great place to be.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1njy2117ygd51.jpg?width=743&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f82259181b1ee2597d5ee24c9bfe9ac30499cc6c

You may have seen headlines talking about over a thousand deaths a day. Because I use 7 day moving averages for daily stats, my charts don’t reflect that yet. But at 940 per day, it’s getting very close. Also note the absolute number of deaths – almost 148,000. [Most of the models](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-forecasts/?cid=rrpromo) are projecting around 165,000 deaths by August 15. These models seem pretty realistic at this point, and 200,000 deaths by the end of the year is certainly a possibility.

You may have noticed at the beginning that LA County had the lowest Zorgi Score – 8.5. Why? Here are the reasons. They aren’t cause for celebration, but at least things are not getting worse in a hurry:

* Cases over the past month increased by 89%, which is high, but low compared to other counties. OC, for example, went up by 178%, and SD increased by 123%.
* Case doubling days didn’t go down, whereas in OC they dropped by 4 days to 24 days, and in SD, they went from 38 days to 27 days.
* Daily cases increased by almost 50%, but again, compared to other counties, this was low.
* Total fatalities increased by just over 30%, but daily fatalities only increased by 22%. Compare that to SD’s increase in daily fatalities of 162%.

Finally, several people have asked me if I think San Diego will get off the Governor’s watch list soon. I always answer with my “I’m not in the prediction business” disclaimer, but the current stats for SD aren’t anything to crow about:

* 123% increase in cases, from just under 12K to almost 28K today.
* Decrease in case doubling days from 38 days to 27 days.
* 92% increase in daily cases, from 267 a day to over 500.
* 50%+ increase in fatalities, to over 500.
* 162% increase in daily fatalities, from 3 to 8 per day.
* a small increase in the positivity rate, from 4.1% to 4.9%.

Within the county, Chula Vista, Lakeside, and Spring Valley continue to be the hotspots. In all three cases, it was the dip in case doubling days that contributed the most to their Zorgi Scores. El Cajon is now at 28 days; Lakeside is at 23 days, and Spring Valley is at 28 days.

CoronavirusCA,SpaceJackRabbit,[Discussion] Pods don't work: Parents' attempts will fail sooner or later,"You may have caught [this recent SF Chronicle story](https://www.sfchronicle.com/education/article/Pandemic-pods-Unfair-option-for-the-privileged-15430625.php) about the parents attempting to ""form ‘pandemic pods’ for the school year"". The story is more about the backlash behind it (it's definitely an option only well-off households have access to) than the science.

Well, I have a couple of anecdotes in that department.

Some acquaintances had their kid (around 8) join a summer camp in a Bay Area county. Small groups, with a handful of parents as chaperones. Supposedly rules were strict, organizers and parents and kids were supposed to socially distance as much as possible, etc. Well, one of the kids tested positive. Camp is over. Kids and adult chaperones now have to test and quarantine, away from the rest of their household.

Some friends have their young kid join the usual daycare, which has slashed number of slots by half, and imposed strict rules to families. Well, one of the kids got kicked out recently. Turns out the kid's parents had been taking frequent, non-essential out-of-county trips - viol, and their social media feed betrayed them. Harsh? The sheer fact that the family had agreed to terms that they almost immediately violated seems, unfortunately, typical. I've heard by now several such stories of parents wanting to enter pods and not following the rules they're supposed to abide by.

Lesson from those is that those pods simply are very, very difficult to make work as soon as they involve more than two families. [Which seems to be the consensus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/parenting/coronavirus-pod-family.html). We've looked around at other households and recently realized we couldn't form a pod with any of them. Either one of the parents works in a high-risk workplace, or they don't follow the same rules and mingle with others, or they have a pod with a set of grandparents at risk and rightfully don't want to expand it.

Has anyone here gotten into a pod with another household? Or more than one?",1,1595888005,california,2020-07-27 18:13:25

CoronavirusCA,n0_kap,Advice Needed,"First, I want to start off saying I am embarrassed to the maximum degree. Sorry this is long as hell, but I need help!

So my father returned home from a trip outside the country last week. Before he left he tells me that he will not be staying at a hotel and he’ll be doing things to take precaution because of the virus. A couple days in to his trip, he FaceTimed me showing how nice his resort/hotel suite was (LIE 1)—He was supposed to stay at his wife’s house. Then he’s telling me how good the food was at a restaurant he went to (LIE 2). Hearing all this made me absolutely angry, so I just remind him that when he returns to the US he has to quarantine for 14 days and then I suggest he gets tested. Of course he says “ok ok…I will. I take COVID seriously.” So before he returns, I get him groceries and cleaning supplies so he has no excuse to leave the house during those 14 days of quarantine. The night he returns home from his trip, he calls me telling me he’s home and again I remind him, “You have to stay in the house for 14 days and quarantine.” He says ok and goes to bed. The next morning he’s sending me pictures of him at the gas station and food from this restaurant that’s an hour away from our house. At this point I am irritated, so I’m telling him again that it’s not cool that he’s out in public WORKING/INTERACTING WITH OTHERS and needed to stay home because he doesn’t know if he has COVID and he could unknowingly infect other people. He just laughs saying he doesn’t have any symptoms and he feels good, so he doesn’t have COVID. I continue to say nothing is funny and he has to take this seriously, just because he has no symptoms doesn’t mean he does not have it and BOOM he hangs up in my face. Fast forward to today…he is still refusing to quarantine and now he refuses to go get tested. His “excuse” for not quarantining is “I have to make money.”

This is my primary home and I work 15 minutes away. Due to his selfish, inconsiderate ways I cannot return home and I have been driving 3 hours round trip to work. 

At this point, I don’t know what to do. He’s full of bullshit and is all talk regarding this virus. PLEASE HELP ME, he just laughs and hangs up anytime I bring up that what he is doing is not cool and he’s putting other people at risk.",1,1595898092,california,2020-07-27 21:01:32

My friend is a former employee of Sushi Den and she just found out that one of her old co-workers tested positive and they are STILL PLANNING ON OPENING TONIGHT. They treat their employees like shit and I have seen this on a first hand basis. There have been a few employees trying to whistleblow but their team is trying to cover it up and the employees are terrified by the reprecussions. some ppl have tried calling them out putting shitty Yelp reviews (ie: Michael W on Yelp. Sushi Den was one of my favorite restaurants in Denver before my friend started working there. They are sexist and it's okay because ""the owners are from Japan and they're set in there ways"". But that's a whole different story. The employees who were exposed to the person who was tested positive are STILL EXPECTED TO COME INTO WORK TODAY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY STAFF THEY HAVE LEFT (due to previous massive layoffs). If they leave, they will not get unemployment benefits AND THEY ARE USING THIS AS A WAY TO BULLY PPL INTO STAYING AND GETTING PEOPLE TO STAY QUIET.

I know sushi den is one of the most popular restaurants in the area so I'm sure they have a ton of reservations.

CoronavirusColorado,MewMewToastMahGoats,I'm so angry. Grand Junction REFUSES to take COVID seriously. Sort of a rant. --Delete if not allowed.,"I don't know what I have to do to make this city to take this seriously, or make Polis put his foot down to Junction. It's pretty obvious that Grand Junction is not testing enough. And if we are, they are hiding the numbers to pretend like we don't have any cases. I find it pretty impossible that our numbers are so low currently and that there has been zero deaths this entire time. When everywhere else is exponentially higher in both cases and deaths by now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because the city is acting this way. Pretty much NO ONE takes the virus seriously at all, here. I enforce masks at my work and the biggest complaint I get is that it's either a fake/hoax, Its over with so no need to worry, and/or the media was exaggerating the whole thing. I'm so tired of getting s\*\*t talked even for just wearing it, let alone enforcing them at my job. And I'm tired of all the blatant disregard for other human beings, from BOTH the city and the citizens. This entire time people have carried on as if this isn't a pandemic and pretty much all resumed normal life immediately after the virus was first announced.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what I can do to get people out here to understand that it's not ""All Good"". If the numbers they are sharing ARE in fact, true. Then it's only just started for us out here, and something needs to get done about it NOW or were gonna get slammed by it. I just don't believe that the numbers are what they say they are. Our county has at least 165,000+ residents. Not only that, but junction alone has so many people visit from other western towns and Utah, so that only bumps the risk up even higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for the long rant. I'm just so frustrated by this whole situation and it feels like I can't do a darn thing about it. I figured posting here would maybe get some people's attention at least, or maybe some advice. At the very least to just share my frustrations. .

He has since devolved into a full Fauci/Gates/antivax conspiracy (this is public info- he has posted about it on company social media) to the point where the website now tells customers to ignore local guidelines regarding masks. The counterbalance is that we don't see too many customers per day- I'd estimate between 2-5 is normal per day, coming from all over CO and WY. I'd estimate about 20% of our customers wear masks. I am the one who largely interacts with customers. It isn't unusual for a day to go by and I'm the only person in the shop (employees and customers) that is wearing a mask

I also want to say that I'm already deep in a search for a new job but I need this one for the time being as I was rejected 3 times over for UI and rent needs to be paid. I've already confronted him about safety protocols 2 times, the first where he said he'd require masks (now shown to be a lie), and the second time I asked, he ignored my question. Again, masks and social distancing are not present in any way. 

I guess I'm looking for advice on whether or not I'm overreacting. Comiseration is welcome as well.

Had it done at an urgent care and there was a $50 copay (Cigna, haven’t met deductible).

I tried several places today to get the free test but every one said only if you have symptoms or are 65+.

Doc said it was 8 day minimum for test results. She’s using Quest but she said LabCorp was just as delayed. 

She’s expecting a big boom in other states this week which means all the smaller places doing testing right now will get shut off tomorrow or Thursday to only focus on people with symptoms.

CoronavirusColorado,timmyduncandonuts,Colorado unemployment question. PUA/UI at separate times??,"Hey. Trying to figure out my best course of action. When the pandemic hit I was moved to part time for two weeks then completely let go April 25. I applied for regular unemployment in Colorado. I made only 1800 in the state of Colorado cause I had just moved there in November and the cut off to be accepted was $2500. I had, however, made close to 5000 in Michigan which I included in my application. Two weeks go by and I get a letter saying my benefits was $0.
I call unemployment and they say wages should be in from other state in 4-6 weeks. I wait that amount of time and when that doesn’t happen I call back and the person I talked to suggest I apply for PUA cause I didn't make enough. I do that and I get accepted. I get payments for 10 weeks. Then I get a determination of eligibility document on the PUA portal saying I no longer get PUA because I have made enough for regular unemployment and that I should apply starting 7/5. When I login into UI website it still has no wages from Michigan reported and my benefits is $0. I call regular unemployment and tell them whats going on and they said a request was never sent to Michigan for wages and they said they’d have someone call me back which never happened.
Next day I see my earnings from Michigan on there and my ui benefit of $130. What the hell? Am I committing fraud now? It was close to 14-16 weeks and they had never sent request for Michigan wages. I called again and and explained to a lady what was happening and asked for guidance. She said something about it being fraud, put me on hold for 20 minutes, told me she was going to process a claim for me, then put me on hold for another 2 hours. A different guy picks up and has no idea who I am and I explain the whole thing to him. After I told him everything all he told me was my payment for regular unemployment was being processed to my bank.
Should I try to recoup the lost weeks through regular unemployment and expect to pay back all the PUA payments I got? This sucks. I don’t want to do the wrong thing nor did I try but not sure what to do now. How was I accepted and continued to get payments for PUA if I was accepted for regular unemployment? I didn't think that was possible.",1,1594214452,colorado,2020-07-08 09:20:52

For the last several months, up until mid-June, we saw the number of confirmed cases hold steady while the number of deaths drop. I've tried to make sense of this as due to gradually increased testing. We are catching more cases, so the confirmed cases to deaths ratio has gradually improved. 

However, the current surge we are seeing nationally is obviously a real surge and just as serious as the initial surge in March/April. Up until this week I was hopeful that Colorado was going to dodge that second wave because maybe we are generally doing things right. How does that hold up?

Seems like a lot of this could be better understood if positive test rates were as widely reported as confirmed cases. Do you know of a data source that includes positive test rates in their graphs?",1,1594401057,colorado,2020-07-10 13:10:57

CoronavirusColorado,lstroyan,Help me understand how you balance the masked-or-not * outside-or-inside * distance * exposure-time = risk equation.,"After attending a small mostly socially distanced gathering a week or so ago, I've been thinking about how hard it is to judge distance and how my behavior is subconsciously influenced by the people around me even with pretty strong intentions going into situations. Herd mentality, mirror neurons, people pleasing, whatever it is, it all gets wrapped up and it's really hard to judge my actions in the moment.

I've thought about getting rods 6' long.  I've never been great with spatial estimation and I'm pretty sure it changes with fear level. The more I know people or trust people, the more safe I feel, and the closer I unconsciously get to them, but then the less I trust myself.  I have a unscientific theory that that is why we are not seeing as much rise from protests as might be expected. People are strangers, and so we are good about safety vigilance as we might not be if we knew them well. It's easy to be vigilant. I thinking can go the other way too,it is easy to get paranoid about things that really aren't a big risk, and not ever be able to let my guard down.

Here's the other thing that I can feel happening in my brain, to my dismay. I believe we are adept as humans at learning from past experiences, especially by trial and error. Combined with ""vigilance fatigue"" as a friend of mine put it , the tendency to think that because in the past I have made myself safe, those precautions keep me safe, and maybe I can even branch out a little, is very tempting.  But just because we've taken some precautions and past situations have turned out fine, doesn't mean our precautions were enough. There probably just wasn't any one infected with COVID at that event. Our precautions make us feel safe, but are they actually accomplishing the opposite? I'd like to understand what others who look at data available are concluding and figure out for myself how to be consistent with my precautions.

 We know that risk depends on whether participants are masked,  the size of the group, exposure time , whether we are indoor or outdoor , etc. I know not everyone can control these variables, and we don't know everything about them yet.. But  if one has the choice to socially distance, how do we balance all of these different factors ? 

Suppose I would like to organize a get together with a small group of friends and/or family outside in a socially distanced manner. Let's say 10 unrelated people to make it interesting.

 So we hear a lot about staying 6 feet apart. If we take that at face value, what does it really mean? Some of my friends were reaching out to see if they had an arm span between them, and that would've been 6 feet from center torso to center torso, but I always assumed 6 feet was the width of the gap. 

Is 6 feet enough if a small group is unmasked outside, eating? For how long? I have been taking it to mean 6 feet with a mask, and I go for 8-10 feet otherwise, unless it's brief, but it's hard to maintain.

I know there are other factors like shared bathrooms and surfaces but I'll leave that separate, I find that easier to stick to my choice. 

I know there will be as many answers to this as there are replies, but I'm just trying to get an idea what we know. Thanks.",1,1594415669,colorado,2020-07-10 17:14:29

CoronavirusColorado,TheWaystone,What would it take to make you think reopening schools was safe / as safe as possible?,"I've worked with and in schools for a long time. I don't know of a single school that could realistically implement even pretty basic standards suggested by the media. They just don't have the staff, the time, or the money. 

Schools near my hometown ran out of money for soap and paper towels in the bathrooms last year. How are they supposed to afford everyone being temp-checked, hand sanitizer, additional handwashing stations, etc. I know our teachers are amazing, but we can't expect them to manage all this themselves - it takes additional staff that schools just can't afford.

And nowhere in Colorado seems to have any coherent plan about what to do about high-risk faculty and staff. Remote positions are few and filled quickly. Many teachers are over the age of 50 and chronically ill. It's just very, very risky for them when the inevitable starts to happen.

So what would it take? I think the alternating schedule is a good idea - 50% of kids in the building max every day, and teachers in very small cohorts that can move more freely because of limited numbers. It's still risky, but it decreases risk quite a bit. But then we have the same issue we've always had - UI runs out and parents don't have childcare. And there's absolutely no plan for childcare of paid family leave. 

What are your ideas?",1,1594421195,colorado,2020-07-10 18:46:35

So I am again posting on behalf of friends who are ex-Sushi Den employees. Last week they chose to open their restaurant even though one of their employees tested positive. The Health Department came by and said it was OK because the employee had not been at work for 3 days. That's apparently their qualification to reopen. (*so if you see restaurants temporarily closing for 3 days, they probably had a positive case*). 

We found out another employee tested positive and some others are waiting for their results. The restaurant has reservations booked out for weeks

Today I watched a non mask wearer have an interaction with a cashier , she basically assumed the cashier was unhappy wearing the mask and that she would be in the camp that thinks this is all overblown , and as much as said so to the cashier. Cashier was a younger lady who politely listened and then smiled and sent her on her way. When I reached the counter I asked her how she felt about the mask and she said that she gets that kind of interaction about half the time from non mask wearers and that she is worried that more people aren't wearing masks. I then asked how many wearing verus not ( assuming she would be a good sample since she is dealing with the public as a cashier) and she said it was 50/50.  Confirming my observations.

Dear Patrons,

Palenque has been diligent about following the mandated COVID-19 guidelines set forth by the state of Colorado, which includes using contactless and disposable menus, mandatory masks and proper social distancing. Our staff thoroughly disinfects and sanitizes each table and chair in between guests and we also hire a professional cleaning company for nightly disinfecting and sanitizing of the entire restaurant. 

Unfortunately, we have had a staff member test positive for COVID-19 after traveling to a hot spot. Our top priority is the safety of our guests and staff, so we have made the choice to close until we have enough staff members show a negative test result so we can safely reopen the restaurant.

This employee worked on July 1st, 3rd, and 5th. If you dined in our restaurant on those dates, we encourage you to get tested to help protect others. 

If you have any concerns, please reach out to us here:

CoronavirusColorado,helpusdrzaius,unpopular - essential workers perspective on masks,"This has been on my mind for a bit and wanted to get it off, here is good as anywhere else. I work in an office environment, lower level position doing lots of legwork. My position was already understaffed, I was working alone in a 2 post position for about a year already. When the shit hit the fan, they went to 50% staffing, for the entire office. Most did one week on, one week work from home. My job is in a IT support position, there are projects that need to get done, but also lots of odd little emergencies that require my presence. The local admins offered to work with me so I could still do my job and follow the same 50% in office staffing rule, my bosses (who are elsewhere) did not. There's more to it than that, but that's the jist of it. Frankly I was insulted, in asking that the same staffing rule be applied to me I felt like I was asking for something that did not belong to me, like I was trying to get away with stealing something. This is the core of it. It's been said before, the position is essential, the worker is not. It was fucked up, why should I have concerned myself with the safety of others when I did not qualify for mine being considered? I felt that my worth was less than those who enjoyed special consideration. There was a lot of resentment, still is there. I don't think I'm alone here. Mentally it can be perceived as a choice between accepting that your worth is less or that those who are enjoying the work from home privileges are less than you, weaker, overly concerned. That this is all over-blown. Of-course that is not a healthy mode of thinking, but I don't think I was unique in thinking it. 

I am not an anti-masker. I first convinced myself that I would wear a mask so my job was not compromised, follow the rules, keep your head low. Job cuts might be coming (and they did come). Now I wear a mask for the other essential workers, those who did not have the luxury of working from home. Also there's lots of people in my office, and I have no resentment towards any of them, I don't wish to compromise their safety. Ultimately I was able to wfh on some limited days, and the support I provided was just the same as me being in office, but I also had little interest in making any more noise about it. 

I hope this was not a complete waste of your time, but to be fair you were going to waste it anyway.",1,1594691954,colorado,2020-07-13 21:59:14
CoronavirusColorado,kuzumby,FREE - Ear Saver Bands For Those In Need - As Seen on Denver's 9 News,"The Happy Ears Project was seen on 9 News Denver and has donated over 23,000 ear savers across the country. We are still making them, and they are completely free for anyone that needs one.  These completely alleviate ear pain by pulling straps off of the ears. Don't forget about all of the kiddos who might be headed back to school next month. These would be perfect for them and the teachers/administrators who will be wearing masks all day.  We are happy to ship orders in the US if need be. No order is too large. 

For more info check out our website: [www.happyearsproject.org](https://www.happyearsproject.org)

Our bands are free, if someone is charging your for ear savers they aren't from The Happy Ears Project.

They're asking for employee voice, proper safety precautions, transparency, and equity to be at the center of the decision-making process on whether to re-open schools.

The ""demands"" are to hold the following expectations:

1. Employees voice and safety must drive decision making through  honoring bargaining rights or a vote of approval from all employees.
2. Safety protections, protocols, and precautions must be provided by our school districts for all students and staff.
3. Our community must be provided with transparency and data that has driven the decision making process.
4. Equity for students, staff, and families must always be provided, no matter where the learning is occurring.

A huge source of anxiety for teachers and families is the lack of leadership from the state. So people with children in one district who work in another are particularly vulnerable to the whims of local politics.",40,1594763063,colorado,2020-07-14 17:44:23

CoronavirusColorado,trash000000001000,"I was Pro Polis, then I read his statements on School Reopening. I wrote this letter to his office."," Governor Polis,

I just read on CPR news that Governor Polis said, “I believe that we can’t interrupt education, we can’t sacrifice our future and our children’s future just because of the pandemic.” I would like to know- if at all possible- how many children’s lives Governor Polis is willing to sacrifice. This statement and the position it reflects places the education of a child over the life of a child. As a future educator, I know it is the first job of a teacher to ensure the safety of all students. With that being said, I think Governor Polis must have a concrete number. 1,000? 2,000? 

I voted for this man, and he is willing to throw our children onto a raging fire? For what cause? School can and should be conducted from a distance. Distance learning is possible- and necessary- due to a pandemic that will kill and maim our most vulnerable populations. If, for whatever reason, the Governor deems in-person education to become necessary, he must admit that he is willfully murdering children. Distance learning can be effective given proper resources. The children are not “falling behind”. They are where they are. When we reopen schools, when it is safe, teachers are trained to understand the gaps in knowledge and how to fill them. However, we cannot do that for dead children. 

When our children die, we will not vote for you. When our parents die, we will not vote for you. When we die, we will not vote for you. It is time to take a stand for morality instead of monetary. You have lost my vote. I refuse to teach in this state- so you have widened the teacher shortage by one more warm body.  

Please write back soon, regarding the number of children you will let die, preferably in addition to the number of teachers you will let die (I wonder, how long has this teacher shortage lasted again?).

Tougher restrictions on restaurants, gyms and other businesses could be coming to El Paso County, health officials warned Tuesday, citing coronavirus cases spiking and hospitals filling in a reversal if favorable conditions that allowed some operations to open more fully under a state-approved waiver.

Officials said residents must get serious about wearing masks and taking other preventative measures to help slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in order to maintain the state variances allowing greater activity. 

""Even though it’s difficult to accept for some of us, it doesn’t make it any less real,"" Dr. Leon Kelly, deputy medical director for El Paso County Public Health, said in a presentation to the El Paso County Commissioners. 

The county has seen 115 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past two weeks as of Tuesday, up from about 25 new cases per 100,000 residents over two weeks in mid-June, according to Public Health data. The state has about 90 new cases per 100,000 residents over two weeks as of Tuesday, up from a low of 43 new cases per 100,000 residents over two weeks in June, according to numbers from Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. 

The percentage of patients testing positive for the disease has also risen to about 7%. The state would like the county to stay below 5% to maintain its variances, Kelly said. 

The variances granted to El Paso County allowed Cheyenne Mountain Zoo to open and many venues such as restaurants, gyms, houses of worship and malls to reopen at a higher capacity than allowed under the state health emergency declaration. In a month, if the county has not succeeded in slowing the virus, the state could revoke the county's variances, Kelly said.

Hospitalizations are also on the rise and in two weeks, if nothing changes, UCHealth may have to stop elective surgeries in order to maintain capacity to treat COVID-19 patients, he said. As of Monday, UCHealth was caring for about 30 patients either hospitalized with COVID-19 or hospitalized awaiting test results, health system spokeswoman Cary Vogrin said.

""They are not in trouble today,"" Kelly said of the hospitals ""...They could be in trouble in the near future.""

The disease is spreading most among younger residents who are less likely to need to hospitalization, but because so many of them are getting sick, there is no doubt some of them will need it, he said. Hospitals in the area can only tolerate about two new cases each day, in part, because COVID-19 patients typically need to stay hospitalized for several weeks, he said. 

Turn around times for test results are also starting to grow again as communities across the state and region see increased cases, Kelly said. The state lab is reaching capacity and starting to send out samples to private labs, which are also getting samples from Texas and and Arizona where the numbers of cases have surged. 

""What we see happening is indisputable ... It does no good to pretend this is not happening,"" Kelly said. 

Mitigation plan

The county submitted its state-required mitigation plan for slowing the spread of the virus on Monday. If following those two weeks, the numbers have not come down, the number of people allowed in some venues will droop based on how many people per 100,000 residents are getting sick. The state currently allows 175 residents to gather indoors in El Paso County and 250 people to gather outside if social distancing can be maintained. The maximum number allowed could go down to 50 people inside and 125 people outside if the spread of virus isn't slowed, according to the state health department. 

Kelly said studies have proven wearing masks can cut the rate of transmission because the disease spreads through droplets that can hang in the air after someone talks or coughs. A survey of the largest Walmart in El Paso County showed about 60% of residents wearing masks, comparable to what's seen across the state. In order to slow the disease further, 80% to 90% of residents need to wear masks, he said.  

Mask mandates can improve compliance. 

""You can only ask people so many times. .... We don’t ask people to not build a fire during a fire ban,"" he said. 

He later asked the officials how they would help slow the spread of disease. 

""What are the five of you going to do to help us stop what is happening right in front of our eyes?"" he challenged. ""What is our city council going to do?""

Commission Chairman Mark Waller said a mask mandate would likely be impossible to enforce and should not be enacted. 

Commissioner Cami Bremer said government should not mandate behaviors, but she would encourage residents to wear mask. 

""I have faith in our community to do the right thing,"" she said. 

Reopening schools

Commissioner Holly Williams said the county cannot get around the standards set by the state and meeting them should be a high priority so schools can reopen. 

Kelly wrote guidelines for schools to follow if they reopen in August, but asking schools to prevent the spread while so many in the area have the virus would be asking them to do the impossible, he said. 

Most local school districts have not yet made decisions about requiring masks.

The county guidelines state that all school staff and students will be “encouraged to wear masks to the greatest extent possible while in proximity to other people” when they return to in-person classes.

Initial plans call for employees to be required to wear masks in classrooms, on buses and elsewhere on school property. To meet social distancing guidelines and allow for more passengers, students riding buses would need to mask up.

Student mask-wearing remains undetermined in many districts, including Colorado Springs School District 11. The district’s “Return to Learn” document for reopening buildings states facial coverings for students will be “highly encouraged but not required” at school, but masks will be required for all employees.

The plans aren't final, D-11 spokeswoman Devra Ashby said.

The district now is “leaning toward students wearing masks,” Ashby said, perhaps with younger students not being required to do so.

“Things will change as we receive more guidance from El Paso County Health,” she said.

At least one school district in the region, School District 49, has decided to require masks for all students, staff and guests in classrooms, hallways, offices, busses and all district facilities.

The decision was based on a D-49 survey that showed teachers and other employees had “stronger expectations for mask wearing” that will “more closely match their needs,” Chief Education Officer Peter Hilts said in a letter to employees and parents. “Requiring masks for everyone increases the confidence and support for staff members, and thereby preserves the option of in-person learning supported by our full workforce.”

D-49 had planned to require staff only to wear masks and recommend students wear masks.

The changing landscape of COVID-19, with a resurgence of cases locally, as well as research from health care experts showing masks are a tool to help prevent the spread, also influenced the decision, D-49 spokesman David Nancarrow said.

Students who didn’t wear them would have to do online learning.

The majority of parents who were among the 3,000 survey participants indicated want an in-person return to classes, instead of a remote learning model, Nancarrow said",8,1594822519,colorado,2020-07-15 10:15:19

Not to mention, how will they be able to provide online learning so that it is equally as good as in person? I don’t see how it will be fair. People who have to stay home to be safe are at a disadvantage to learning, while people at school are at risk of spreading the virus. And teachers will have to work twice as hard, while they’re already at risk of the virus as well.

I appreciate and understand the value of education and wanting students to live normal lives again, but it will never be normal until there’s at least a vaccine and rushing school just doesn’t seem like the best idea even educationally.

CoronavirusColorado,WorriedWeldCo,What are the state guidelines for offices?,"I was wondering if someone could clarify what the restrictions are for offices in Colorado. I’ve tried to find the information without luck.

I work in Weld County and live in Larimer. My understanding is that offices have limited capacity here in Larimer. I know Weld decided to open up and take zero precautions, but it seems like my work is being completely irresponsible and has to be violating state regulations. At least I hope they are, as I don’t feel safe going to work.

It’s a large building with many people and no one is working from home. Cubicles have plexiglass extenders, but besides that, it’s business as usual. They have temperature screening upon entry and HR says you must stay 6ft apart, wear a mask at your desk and it only comes off to eat or drink. People are very good at wearing masks while walking around, and I would guess there’s about 50% wearing masks 100% of the time, but the other half have the mask under their nose or chin, or completely off at their desk. There are hundreds of people in an open work environment. There’s no social distancing. People come within a few feet of me constantly. 

Any advice? Can they do this? It doesn’t seem safe and I can’t quit. I thought 50% capacity was required for offices, while we’re at 100%.",1,1594901631,colorado,2020-07-16 08:13:51

We've all been hearing stories about the places who are sucking, so I wanted to show some love to a local place that was doing their best and, imo, killing it.  tl;dR: it was great and safety forward. Really impressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I bought tickets online, which you have to do because they're limiting groups and going on individual guided tours of each room. My tickets were for 9:20am. At 9:25a they went over their safety rules: try to keep some distance between each other and masks must be worn over the noise (which I felt was an appropriate reminder). Our group was small, probably 10 adults and 5 children. Only the children under 2 weren't wearing masks, but all the adults did without a fuss. We had a great time, our group-mates were respectful of our space as we were of theirs. The young children obviously got closer but the adults really made an effort. We spent 20 minutes in the first two rooms which was a perfect amount, everyone got to see everything, then about 30 minutes in the big butterfly room. They had several hand-sanitizing stations set up and I saw staff cleaning the entire time, especially ""high touch areas"" (interactive screens, aquarium walls, etc). There were two or so groups that came in to the big room about 10 minutes after us and it kind of felt crowded at some points but I wasn't uncomfortable- there was always a clear space to go. The gift shop was gorgeous and had snacks and such, which was appreciated because I forgot my water bottle.  We ate on the benches outside by ourselves. The Garden was open but we didn't check it out.

&amp;#x200B;

Over all I'm really happy. I was  trepidatious about going out but they seemed to be taking safety precautions seriously, glad I tried it. Tickets were **so** affordable and it felt nice to support them!

* According to [rt.live](https://rt.live), our current R0 is higher than it was when we implemented a shelter in place order and has been for a month. 
* Our weekly case counts have been higher than the case counts we had when we closed school, for again, over a month
* The incidence curve on the state's own covid data site shows that in a month our case incidence rate has tripled, and even quadrupled in some places
* Our hospitalization rate is accelerating
* Our # of people currently hospitalized is the worst its been in 6 weeks
* Our RT # is higher than all the current hotspots in the US

Consider also that all of the above is painting a picture, optimistically, of 2 weeks ago, and with how behind our testing is, it may be closer to 3 weeks.   


* Why are we talking about opening schools when last week our weekly case counts were **six times** **higher** than when we shut school down in the spring?
* Why is in person dining still okay when we've had higher average daily case counts for a month straight than when we initially implemented shelter in place?

We got a taste of what exponential growth looks like back in March/April, if we hit that kind of growth pacing now, when our daily case count is 10x higher, Colorado is going to be in big trouble. And given that we know it takes 2-3 weeks for us to start slowing down after we hit the brakes, isn't it at least time to talk about stepping on them?

I have spent the last week in agony and stress over the smallest details, from how to get kids to and from the bathroom to how to develop a master schedule that provides planning time, lunch, PE, and still enables teachers and students to come in contact with the smallest number of people possible and only within their cohort. I have been angry and sad and afraid, and it has been the hardest year of my career. 

And when I see these idiots not wearing their masks, not wearing them out of compassion for others or not wearing them because it's the rule, and I realize that if we had all been wearing masks this whole time we might not be in this position and over 130000 people might not be dead and my children, students and staff might have a much better chance of a semi-normal year. But no - you and your freedom and your selfishness and your whiny Karen selves have put us here. So yes, I can't take walking silently next to people not wearing masks anymore.

As the title states, I would like to help virtually tutor kids this fall to help out the kids with virtual learning and to hopefully give the parents an hour to themselves.

I am currently employed full time as a CPA in Boulder, but I work completely remotely, and I have enough flexibility in my schedule to spare an hour or two a day to help out. While I am not a teacher and do not have kids of my own, I have an undergraduate and graduate degree in accounting and love learning and teaching.

I would like to volunteer to help out some parents who really need an extra hand with balancing childcare, teaching, and their own work schedules. As I mentioned above, I do not have my own kids, so I am out of the loop on the details about how virtual learning will work. 

Do schools have any programs set up for volunteer opportunities like this? If not, is there/could there be something setup to help connect volunteer tutors to parents and students who need help?",53,1595172270,colorado,2020-07-19 11:24:30
CoronavirusColorado,throwawaytoday12123,"Thinking about sending your child to school? This is from a dad in another state, but still a good read.","For anyone trying to make the decision between physical or virtual school for themselves or their children:

Best argument for virtual school I have read, written by a dad. It's long.....but dang, it made me think a LOT.  He takes every argument and recontextualizes it with appropriate analogies. The last four paragraphs are the chilling clincher.  Thanks for sharing, Karen Lulich Horwath.  Every school district in the world is having these discussions RIGHT NOW - or they should be......

Written by a dad in Fairfax county read.
From Joe Morice, daughters in 8th &amp; 10th grade in our Centreville Pyramid:
 
To our fellow FCPS families, this is it gang, 5 days until the 2 days in school vs. 100% virtual decision. Let’s talk it out, in my traditional mammoth TL/DR form.

Like all of you, I’ve seen my feed become a flood of anxiety and faux expertise. You’ll get no presumption of expertise here. This is how I am looking at and considering this issue and the positions people have taken in my feed and in the hundred or so FCPS discussion groups that have popped up. The lead comments in quotes are taken directly from my feed and those boards. Sometimes I try to rationalize them. Sometimes I’m just punching back at the void.

Full disclosure, we initially chose the 2 days option and are now having serious reservations. As I consider the positions and arguments I see in my feed, these are where my mind goes. Of note, when I started working on this piece at 12:19 PM today the COVID death tally in the United States stood at 133,420.

*****“My kids want to go back to school.”*****
I challenge that position. I believe what the kids desire is more abstract. I believe what they want is a return to normalcy. They want their idea of yesterday. And yesterday isn’t on the menu.

*****“I want my child in school so they can socialize.”*****
This was the principle reason for our 2 days decision. As I think more on it though, what do we think ‘social’ will look like? There aren’t going to be any lunch table groups, any lockers, any recess games, any study halls, any sitting next to friends, any talking to people in the hallway, any dances. All of that is off the menu. So, when we say that we want the kids to benefit from the social experience, what are we deluding ourselves into thinking in-building socialization will actually look like in the Fall?

*****“My kid is going to be left behind.”*****

Left behind who? The entire country is grappling with the same issue, leaving all children in the same quagmire. Who exactly would they be behind? I believe the rhetorical answer to that is “They’ll be behind where they should be,” to which I’ll counter that “where they should be” is a fictional goal post that we as a society have taken as gospel because it maps to standardized tests which are used to grade schools and counties as they chase funding.

*****“Classrooms are safe.”*****

At the current distancing guidelines from FCPS middle and high schools would have no more than 12 people (teachers + students) in a classroom (I acknowledge this number may change as FCPS considers the Commonwealth’s 3 ft with a mask vs. 6 ft position, noting that FCPS is all mask regardless of the distance). For the purpose of this discussion we’ll say classes run 45 minutes.

I posed the following question to 40 people today, representing professional and management roles in corporations, government agencies, and military commands: “Would your company or command have a 12 person, 45 minute meeting in a conference room?”

100% of them said no, they would not. These are some of their answers:

“No. Until further notice we are on Zoom.”
“(Our company) doesn’t allow us in (company space).”
“Oh hell no.”
“No absolutely not.”
“Is there a percentage lower than zero?”
“Something of that size would be virtual.”

We do not even consider putting our office employees into the same situation we are contemplating putting our children into. And let’s drive this point home: there are instances here when commanding officers will not put soldiers, ACTUAL SOLDIERS, into the kind of indoor environment we’re contemplating for our children. For me this is as close to a ‘kill shot’ argument as there is in this entire debate. How do we work from home because buildings with recycled air are not safe, because we don’t trust other people to not spread the virus, and then with the same breath send our children into buildings?

*****“Children only die .0016 of the time.”*****

First, conceding we’re an increasingly morally bankrupt society, but when did we start talking about children’s lives, or anyone’s lives, like this? This how the villain in movies talks about mortality, usually 10-15 minutes before the good guy kills him.

If you’re in this camp, and I acknowledge that many, many people are, I’m asking you to consider that number from a slightly different angle.

FCPS has 189,000 children. .0016 of that is 302. 302 dead children are the Calvary Hill you’re erecting your argument on. So, let’s agree to do this: stop presenting this as a data point. If this is your argument, I challenge you to have courage equal to your conviction. Go ahead, plant a flag on the internet and say, “Only 302 children will die.” No one will. That’s the kind action on social media that gets you fired from your job. And I trust our social media enclave isn’t so careless and irresponsible with life that it would even, for even a millisecond, enter any of your minds to make such an argument.

Considered another way: You’re presented with a bag with 189,000 $1 bills. You’re told that in the bag are 302 random bills, they look and feel just like all the others, but each one of those bills will kill you. Do you take the money out of the bag?

Same argument, applied to the 12,487 teachers in FCPS (per Wikipedia), using the ‘children’s multiplier’ of .0016 (all of us understanding the adult mortality rate is higher). That’s 20 teachers. That’s the number you’re talking about. It’s very easy to sit behind a keyboard and diminish and dismiss the risk you’re advocating other people assume. Take a breath and think about that.

If you want to advocate for 2 days a week, look, I’m looking for someone to convince me. But please, for the love of God, drop things like this from your argument. Because the people I know who’ve said things like this, I know they’re better people than this. They’re good people under incredible stress who let things slip out as their frustration boils over. So, please do the right thing and move on from this, because one potential outcome is that one day, you’re going to have to stand in front of St. Peter and answer for this, and that’s not going to be conversation you enjoy.

*****“Hardly any kids get COVID.”*****

(Deep sigh) Yes, that is statistically true as of this writing. But it is a cherry-picked argument because you’re leaving out an important piece.

One can reasonably argue that, due to the school closures in March, children have had the least EXPOSURE to COVID. In other words, closing schools was the one pandemic mitigation action we took that worked. There can be no discussion of the rate of diagnosis within children without also acknowledging they were among our fastest and most quarantined people. Put another way, you cannot cite the effect without acknowledging the cause.

*****“The flu kills more people every year.”*****

(Deep sigh). First of all, no, it doesn’t. Per the CDC, United States flu deaths average 20,000 annually. COVID, when I start writing here today, has killed 133,420 in six months.

And when you mention the flu, do you mean the disease that, if you’re suspected of having it, everyone, literally everyone in the country tells you stay the f- away from other people? You mean the one where parents are pretty sure their kids have it but send them to school anyway because they have a meeting that day, the one that every year causes massive f-ing outbreaks in schools because schools are petri dishes and it causes kids to miss weeks of school and leaves them out of sports and band for a month? That one? Because you’re right - the flu kills people every year. It does, but you’re ignoring the why. It’s because there are people who are a--holes who don’t care about infecting other people. In that regard it’s a perfect comparison to COVID.

*****“Almost everyone recovers.”*****

You’re confusing “release from the hospital” and “no longer infected” with “recovered.” I’m fortunate to only know two people who have had COVID. One my age and one my dad’s age. The one my age described it as “absolute hell” and although no longer infected cannot breathe right. The one my dad’s age was in the hospital for 13 weeks, had to have a trach ring put in because she could no longer be on a ventilator, and upon finally getting home and being faced with incalculable time in rehab told my mother, “I wish I had died.”

While I’m making every effort to reach objectivity, on this particular point, you don’t know what the f- you’re talking about.

*****“If people get sick, they get sick.”*****

First, you mistyped. What you intended to say was “If OTHER people get sick, they get sick.” And shame on you.

*****“I’m not going to live my life in fear.”*****

You already live your life in fear. For your health, your family’s health, your job, your retirement, terrorists, extremists, one political party or the other being in power, the new neighbors, an unexpected home repair, the next sunrise. What you meant to say was, “I’m not prepared to add ANOTHER fear,” and I’ve got news for you: that ship has sailed. It’s too late. There are two kinds of people, and only two: those that admit they’re afraid, and those that are lying to themselves about it.

As to the fear argument, fear is the reason you wait up when your kids stay out late, it’s the reason you tell your kids not to dive in the shallow water, to look both ways before crossing the road. Fear is the respect for the wide world that we teach our children. Except in this instance, for reasons no one has been able to explain to me yet.

*****“FCPS leadership sucks.”*****

I will summarize my view of the School Board thusly: if the 12 of you aren’t getting into a room together because it represents a risk, don’t tell me it’s OK for our kids. I understand your arguments, that we need the 2 days option for parents who can’t work from home, kids who don’t have internet or computer access, kids who needs meals from the school system, kids who need extra support to learn, and most tragically for kids who are at greater risk of abuse by being home. All very serious, all very real issues, all heartbreaking. No argument.

But you must first lead by example. Because you’re failing when it comes to optics. All your meetings are online. What our children see is all of you on a Zoom telling them it’s OK for them to be exactly where you aren’t. I understand you’re not PR people, but you really should think about hiring some.

*****“I talked it over with my kids.”*****
Let’s put aside for a moment the concept of adults effectively deferring this decision to children, the same children who will continue to stuff things into a full trash can rather than change it out. Yes, those hygienic children.

Listen, my 15 year old daughter wants a sport car, which she’s not getting next year because it would be dangerous to her and to others. Those kinds of decisions are our job. We step in and decide as parents, we don’t let them expose themselves to risks because their still developing and screen addicted brains narrow their understanding of cause and effect.

We as parents and adults serve to make difficult decisions. Sometimes those are in the form of lessons, where we try to steer kids towards the right answer and are willing to let them make a mistake in the hopes of teaching better decision making the next time around. This is not one of those moments. The stakes are too high for that. This is a “the adults are talking” moment. Kids are not mature enough for this moment. That is not an attack on your child. It is a broad statement about all children. It is true of your children and it was true when we were children. We need to be doing that thinking here, and “Johnny wants to see Bobby at school” cannot be the prevailing element in the equation.

*****“The teachers need to do their job.”*****
How is it that the same society which abruptly shifted to virtual students only three months ago, and offered glowing endorsements of teachers stating, “we finally understand how difficult your job is,” has now shifted to “screw you, do your job.” There are myriad problems with that position but for the purposes of this piece let’s simply go with, “You’re not looking for a teacher, you’re looking for the babysitter you feel your property tax payment entitles you to.”

*****“Teachers have a greater chance to being killed by a car than they do of dying from COVID.”*****

(Eye roll) Per the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the U.S. see approximately 36,000 auto fatalities a year. Again, there have been 133,420 COVID deaths in the United States through 12:09 July 10, 2020. So no, they do not have a great chance of being killed in a car accident.

And, if you want to take the actual environment into consideration, the odds of a teacher being killed in a car accident in their classroom, you know, the environment we’re actually talking about, that’s right around 0%.

*****“If the grocery store workers can be onsite what are the teachers afraid of?”*****

(Deep breath) A grocery store worker, who absolutely risks exposure, has either six feet of space or a plexiglass shield between them and individual adult customers who can grasp their own mortality whose transactions can be completed in moments, in a 40,000 SF space.

A teacher is with 11 ‘customers’ who have not an inkling what mortality is, for 45 minutes, in a 675 SF space, six times a day.

Just stop.

*****“Teachers are choosing remote because they don’t want to work.”*****

(Deep breaths) Many teachers are opting to be remote. That is not a vacation. They’re requesting to do their job at a safer site. Just like many, many people who work in buildings with recycled air have done. And likely the building you’re not going into has a newer and better serviced air system than our schools.

Of greater interest to me is the number of teachers choosing the 100% virtual option for their children. The people who spend the most time in the buildings are the same ones electing not to send their children into those buildings. That’s something I pay attention to.

*****“I wasn’t prepared to be a parent 24/7” and “I just need a break.”*****

I truly, deeply respect that honesty. Truth be told, both arguments have crossed my mind. Pre COVID, I routinely worked from home 1 – 2 days a week. The solace was nice. When I was in the office, I had an actual office, a room with a door I could close, where I could focus. During the quarantine that hasn’t always been the case. I’ve been frustrated, I’ve been short, I’ve gone to just take a drive and get the hell away for a moment and been disgusted when one of the kids sees me and asks me to come for a ride, robbing me of those minutes of silence. You want to hear silence. I get it. I really, really do.

Here’s another version of that, admittedly extreme. What if one of our kids becomes one of the 302? What’s that silence going to sound like? What if you have one of those matted frames where you add the kid’s school picture every year? What if you don’t get to finish the pictures?

*****“What does your gut tell you to do?”*****

Shawn and I have talked ad infinitum about all of these and other points. Two days ago, at mid-discussion I said, “Stop, right now, gut answer, what is it,” and we both said, “virtual.”

A lot of the arguments I hear people making for the 2 days sound like we’re trying to talk ourselves into ignoring our instincts, they are almost exclusively, “We’re doing 2 days, but…”. There’s a fantastic book by Gavin de Becker, The Gift of Fear, which I’ll minimize for you thusly: your gut instinct is a hardwired part of your brain and you should listen to it. In the introduction he talks about elevators, and how, of all living things, humans are the only ones that would voluntarily get into a soundproof steel box with a potential predator just so they could skip a flight of stairs.

I keep thinking that the 2 days option is the soundproof steel box. I welcome, damn, beg, anyone to convince me otherwise.

At the time I started writing at 12:09 PM, 133,420 Americans had died from COVID. Upon completing this draft at 7:04 PM, that number rose to 133,940.

520 Americans died of COVID while I was working on this. In seven hours.

* CDPHE recieved additional public health data and revised models last week. Its looking bad. 
* The model shows that CO would be out of or very short of hospital beds in September. 
* what they saw in the models instigated the statewide public mask mandate from Polis.
* Governor and mayors may take additional action.
* it's unlikely that we will have another statewide stay-at-home order but not completely out of bounds. County stay-at-home orders are more likely.

I have talked to them every few weeks since the pandemic. This is the most pessimistic they have seemed since April.

After reviewing the CDC's official published report on U.S. weekly death statistics, he concluded that at this point in time it is very likely the COVID death toll in the US is over 200,000 when compared to the max deaths of previous years OR ALMOST 300,000 when compared to the average deaths in previous years.

How is this not being discussed more frequently that the death toll so far may be potentially DOUBLE the official numbers. Unless people are magically dying of something else, I don't see a way to refute this evidence.",19,1595264825,colorado,2020-07-20 13:07:05

The points and counterpoints people are expressing are valuable. This is really one situation in which the concerns that everyone has are valid. 

One thing that I have failed to see people discuss is how essential workers are navigating this and how they will be supported in the event of school closures. 

I don't have family here who can watch my young (under 6) kids, much less virtual/home-school them full time. 

Most essential workers (myself included) aren't making enough to hire a private tutor or even a college student to teach my children and watch them during the week. As a community we require that electricity, internet, water, food services, medical, mental health, law enforcement and social support services continue uninterrupted. 

If schools close again, what will be done to support these families?  Will there be a plan to prioritize  support so these kids can receive some type of education and employees can do their jobs to keep society functioning? 

How does the community expect to have these pieces of infrastructure maintained if we also need to be at home to teach our children? 

I just really wanted to validate the feelings and give some visibility to so many other ""essential"" families right now, in which the ""choice"" to send your children back to school is not a choice.",81,1595272223,colorado,2020-07-20 15:10:23

CoronavirusColorado,doogiedc,"Suggestion: Face Shields for ""Medical Exemptions"" to face masks","I work in a medical facility. We had an individual today claiming a medical exemption for respiratory factors. My coworker thought quickly and offered this person a face shield which is generally reserved for staff but extremely easy to disinfect. This person declined and then agreed to put on a face mask to our collective amazement. A few days ago we had an individual claiming a medical exemption and then citing constitutional rights in the same sentence. That made it hard to believe the medical exemption. I realize face shields are not exactly in high supply right now, but I just had to share this story from the front line. I think that there are a variety of people exploiting the medical exemption falsely because they simply don't want to be inconvenienced. The face shields are an even bigger inconvenience but pose no threat to respiratory illness. They still offer some protection from large respiratory droplets from sneezing and coughing, which are more likely to infect. I am a little frustrated because there was no guidance in the executive order to prevent people from lying. And many people are lying about it. Maybe a doctor's note? If there is a true exemption, have a doctor sign off on it. Workers on the front lines having to enforce this don't really have any guidelines. I fully support the governor implementing the executive order. It may benefit from some tweaking to supply workers with a plan for noncompliance.  BTW, our plan for individuals who truly have an exemption would be to schedule them at a time when minimal to no one else is in the office and to isolate them as much as possible. It's got to be tough for workers in retail who don't have those options. I feel for you guys.",80,1595378653,colorado,2020-07-21 20:44:13

CoronavirusColorado,JeffInBoulder,"Can You Become Reinfected With Covid? It's Very Unlikely, Experts Say","File this article in Today's New York times under uplifting/hopeful news.  The main takeaway is that the more we learn about COVID-19, the more it seems to behave very similar to what we already know about other Coronaviruses

Article Link: [https://nyti.ms/2BloYGM](https://nyti.ms/2BloYGM) 

Summary of key points:

Reinfection is theoretically possible but likely to be extremely rare, most of the cases/anecdotes being reported are much more likely to be original infection dragging on and coming/going. *""...choice words for the physicians who caused the panic over reports of reinfections. “This is so bad, people have lost their minds,” he said. “It’s just sensationalist click bait.”*

Also talks about immunity and the role antibodies play.

*""...a drop in antibodies is perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. Many clinicians are “scratching their heads saying, ‘What an extraordinarily odd virus that it’s not leading to robust immunity,’ but they’re totally wrong,’” Dr. Mina said. “It doesn’t get more textbook than this.”*

The article goes on into further detail about the role that T-cells and B-cells play in immunity, and why the observed drop in antibodies doesn't necessarily mean that immunity also drops off.

Finally there is information that the ""Novel"" Coronavirus may not actually be so ""Novel"" to some people's immune systems:

*“A level of pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV2 appears to exist in the general population,” said Dr. Antonio Bertoletti, a virologist at Duke NUS Medical School in Singapore.*

*The immunity may have been stimulated by* [*prior exposure*](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/5/48/eabd2071) *to coronaviruses that cause common colds. These T cells may not thwart infection, but they would blunt the illness and may explain why some people with Covid-19 have mild to no symptoms.*

Finally it talks to the odds of achieving Herd Immunity from a vaccine and the fact that it doesn't have to be completely effective to still end the pandemic:

*“We achieve herd immunity all the time with less than perfect vaccines,” said Dr. Saad Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. “It’s very rare in fact to have vaccines that are 100-percent effective.”*

On the whole this is a rather positive read from a major reputable news source, in among so much bad news each day, and gives high hope for the success of the several vaccines which are in large-scale trials and showing positive results.",35,1595474712,colorado,2020-07-22 23:25:12

I recently had an unfortunate experience at a local business where the owner was walking around without a mask on(all other employees were in masks) while myself and another customer was inside the shop. Is there some way to report these businesses for non-compliance? I was shocked and saddened that this guy seems not to care about his customers.",3,1595545978,colorado,2020-07-23 19:12:58
CoronavirusColorado,hola_n_stuff,How easy has it been for you to get tested?,"I’m genuinely curious, because for our family in the Springs it’s been very easy. My infant daughter got tested the same day at a children’s hospital testing site in the parking lot of her pediatrician—no wait, results the next day (negative). I myself was tested Tuesday (No results yet, pretty sure I’m negative) at my primary care provider right in the exam room, as simply and easily as a strep or flu test. Both of us had super mild and almost ignorable symptoms—but my husband does work in a hospital, and I told them that, so I think that was what made the drs test us. Just curious what everyone else’s experience has been. Edit: The nurse gave me a great tip: right after the test (which burns Iike crazy), blow your nose. Burn goes away instantly.

CoronavirusColorado,hairylikeabear,I’ve changed my mind on school openings,"Most people who regularly post on here know that I’ve been a strong advocate for opening most Colorado schools in-person this fall. I attended a meeting last night that has caused me to drastically shift my opinion on this matter. I still believe that in-person school is the most effective route of providing education and should be what we need to shoot for. I also still believe that a district, **with proper planning and resources**, can safely provide in-person education this fall. What I saw last night leads me to believe that in-person education is going to be incredibly ineffective, a complete clusterfuck, and will be discontinued weeks into the school year because district and school leadership have absolutely zero clue what they are doing and instead of having an actual plan with details and contingencies and specifics have an loosely organized system.

Questions that were unable to be answered include:

1. If test results take 8-10 days to return, when do members of a student’s cohort more to remote learning? Upon a classmate having COVID symptoms or upon test results?

2. Will proper medical PPE be provided to special ed teachers needing to feed, toilet, and transfer high needs students?

3. What happens if a student shows up without a mask?

4. Is there enough hand sanitizer and soap available?

5. Will school nurses be able to write orders for students and staff to receive COVID testing at local testing sites?

6. If a class of students needs to go remote during the middle of the school year, how will the school help transition them from in-person to remote? How will they get quick access to learning materials and tech during the transition?

7. (Current plan is to move a class to remote learning if a student in class tests positive) Do you have a plan to move students who have had contact with a positive student outside of class to remote learning? Actual answer: “I don’t see how they could have that contact” What about contact through sports or clubs or social interactions? No answer

8. (Current plan is to have janitorial staff clean rooms while teachers have plan periods) Have you hired additional janitors to provide this cleaning? Answer: No

9. Where will teachers go to conduct their planning period if their room is being deep cleaned during planning?

I’m sure I am missing a few. These are basic fucking logistical questions. I’m still in favor of districts with well-formulated plans and specific details moving forward. This nonsense of “We’re doing a cohort model!” Well how does that work? “Not a clue” is straight BS that leads me to believe that the plan for some districts was to hope it went away by fall and when it didn’t they threw out the first plan they thought of, left out the details, and called it a day. If districts and admin aren’t going to make sure that in-person school has the best chances possible of being effective given the circumstances, it’s not even worth bothering. Districts should follow BVSD and immediately begin formulating how to setup supervision plans for families without other options, because one way or another we are dead set on a path that will doom a generation of low income students to perpetual poverty and other negative outcomes.",160,1595611240,colorado,2020-07-24 13:20:40

I wrote code that **converts the Johns Hopkins timeseries \*cumulative\* counts into \*daily\* counts of cases and deaths for all counties**.  These daily counts begin March 24th and are in csv files that anyone can download and import into GIS or spreadsheet software.  I made a PDF with details about (1) the interactive map and (2) these csv files.

CoronavirusColorado,BbyRichard,Just need reassurance that I’m not crazy?!,"My SO and I have been very careful since March. They’re in a higher risk category and it’s actually been kind of nice to have a summer free from responsibilities and the ability to save money. Our family and friends have all also been pretty good about quarantining over the summer and respecting us. 

However, I’m not sure if people are just “over it”, don’t care anymore, or the cheap flight prices are too tempting but we’ve been guilt tripped almost daily lately for not allowing friends to come visit (they argue we can just go hiking, etc.), not returning to our home state to visit (Frontier flights are ridiculously cheap), etc. They’ve tried to compromise by saying we’ll wear masks, etc. but that doesn’t make up for the fact that 1. We haven’t even been to a bar or restaurant since March 2. A mask doesn’t negate the fact they or we would be in a plane with potentially sick people or asymptomatic people. 

My question is are we taking this too seriously?! I feel like I’m losing my mind! A big reason we don’t want to get COVID or be exposed (aside from the unknowns, obviously potentially dying, and my SO being in a higher risk category) is that we’re both spending a ton of money to attend grad school - if we miss a semester due to being sick or our grades slip because one or both of us gets sick that’s literally thousands of dollars directly down the drain. Plus potentially our future careers. 

No one seems to think these are valid reasons and I’m starting to question if we are taking this all too seriously...?",1,1596048155,colorado,2020-07-29 14:42:35

I recently lost my job, and I’ve applied for unemployment, but it’s giving me a very low amount (like a tenth of my former pay). I think it’s because when all this went down, my store reduced hours and I applied in case it ended up being long term. I never claimed it, and when I lost my job long after we returned to full hours I put in a new claim. The claim doesn’t seem to be updating to reflect that, even though it shows I’m gonna irking zero hours now, and I can’t get an appointment until the end of August or a callback until mid September. 

Does anyone know of a way to deal with this or fix it that doesn’t involve being broke for over a month? Is there something I need to do online or is there a way to get ahold of someone in enough time to be helpful?

He wears a mask at work and reportedly wipes things down but he also thinks this is all basically a hoax and only does the bare minimum that his employer dictates. So I don't trust him to be genuinely serious about it.

My mom is immunocompromised and I'm fat so I'm really worried he'll get it, or already have gotten it from his co-worker, and he'll spread it to us.

What should I do? Is it crazy to think I need to take measures like getting my mom to a hotel if my dad refuses to get tested or quarantine? Does he even need to at this point?

Sometimes I feel like the general advice we get is more utilitarian, more geared towards making sure the general death rate is low, rather than making sure my actual specific mom doesn't die. So it's hard to know if I need to be more extreme than what is recommended.",1,1596227979,colorado,2020-07-31 16:39:39

Worse, better, about the same?","I ask because a former Jacksonville Mayor mentioned that the RNC was decided to come to Jacksonville because Florida was doing well. Does anyone have any sources on how well FL was doing?


&gt;Former Mayor and UNF President John Delaney, who’s now the chair of the Civic Council, sat down with News4Jax political analyst Rick Mullaney, who’s the director of the Public Policy Institute at Jacksonville University, on “This Week in Jacksonville.”
&gt;“If you were mayor today, whether it was a Republican or Democratic convention, would you be seeking to hold it here in Jacksonville today?” Mullaney asked.
&gt;Delaney responded: “I think every mayor wakes up, trying to find a way to help the economy and bring more jobs to town. Whether it’s the Jehovah’s Witness, whether it’s a massive rock festival, I think everybody goes, ‘Yes.' The climate’s tough now with that virus, and it has become kind of stigmatized between the two parties. And then keep in mind, when the decision was made, the infection rates were dropping. Florida was ahead of the rest of the country. Jacksonville was ahead of Florida. The last week has been tougher, and I think it makes the call harder.”",1,1593631968,florida,2020-07-01 15:32:48

I was told by a family member working in a nursing home that there was an elder man that was being given CPR by the nurses and staff for about 7 minutes before Paramedics arrived. They said that standard rule is to give CPR for about 20 minutes before declaring the patient dead. However, they declared him dead as soon as they got to the scene and did not try any other means to revive. I was told that Paramedics in the past have been able to bring people back in those 20 minutes of trying to revive the patient. The entire staff in the building was in shock that the paramedics declared the man dead before the required time. My question is has anyone noticed this here in Florida? Is this because even if he was brought back there wouldn't be room for him at the hospital? Would he have been at a high risk of getting corona at the hospital and dying either way?

Require masks and social distancing (though both are done poorly and inconsistently by the majority of workers).

Define exposure as being within 6 ft of a confirmed positive case without a mask for more than fifteen minutes, so that no one is ever considered exposed due to above requirement.

Only tell people you think are “exposed” that the person is positive (though everyone finds out anyway but are not allowed to stop working even if they feel they were exposed).

Don’t encourage testing for anyone, exposed or otherwise, unless symptoms are very serious, preventing you from knowing who is actually infected.

coronavirusflorida,sgonz272,How to report lab companies that are misrepresenting antibodies tests as COVID-19 tests?,"Hi! I'm not entirely sure if this is a concern everywhere in Florida, but in South Florida I have heard from multiple close family members and friends that they ""got the COVID-19 test done"" and paid $100 to get their results ASAP. For some context, the majority of the city testing sites are taking 7-10 days to provide results, therefore being able to receive results instantly or within 48 hrs is driving people to be interested in paying to get quicker results. However, some places that are doing so-called COVID-19 tests for $100 for quick results are actually doing antibodies tests, which is NOT the same. My uncle repeatedly tested at this one site, which claimed multiple times it was the coronavirus test, then my cousin went with his girlfriend and asked to confirm that it was the covid test and not the antibodies test and was assured that it was the covid test and not antibodies test. Upon receiving his results, he found that it was the antibodies test and they lied/mislead him to believe it was the COVID test. I want to know if there is any way to report a company like this and who should they be reported to? This is NOT ok. They are misinforming their patients that may very well be infected. They're inevitably receiving negative results for the antibodies test and may have the virus. As a result, they're going to work and putting at risk the lives of so many people.",1,1594941074,florida,2020-07-16 19:11:14

It's not that they don't get it.  Most parents I know have their children locked up safe, and never take them in public unless it can't be avoided.  That's why there are less children with it. 

If they were out and about, there would be more.  I almost never see kids out.  I have only taken mine out maybe three times since this started.

According to solid evidence, Mary Ellen Ralph, 66-year old, living now happily in Crystal River, Florida, was infected with Coronavirus last July and luckily survived. She was diagnosed as pneumonia, with ground-glass lung images and upper respiratory symptoms. All these manifestations matched with those of Covid-19. Her blood sample has been tested and confirmed now by some friends of mine in the hospital as Covid-19 positive.  

Additionally, there were three similar cases in the neighboring county Ocala from June to August last year, Enna Maulseed, Judy Marie McIntosh and Dean Harris. They also went through a series of tests and were diagnosed as pneumonia back then. Unfortunately, they didn’t make it. May they rest in peace. 

This leads to a cluster of coronavirus infections last summer in Florida. Apparently, Mary Ellen from Crystal River is proved to be one of the earliest cases in the States, along with three similar cases and more nearby. All these add up to one conclusion: Florida was where the virus began in mid2019.  The only question is whether this was covered up or simply neglected.",1,1595859234,florida,2020-07-27 10:13:54

I did not shop online like this before, but Jesus tap dancing Christ, the longer I am forced to do this, the less likely I am to change back to being an in person shopper, because I will have figured out all the tricks.  I don’t understand why Florida’s leadership isn’t making their 100% focus ERADICATING THE VIRUS like other countries have.  I am so sick of hearing about their focus on the economy!!

Hire thousands of contract tracers.  Open up hotels and provide paid quarantine housing where you provide food so people will actually get out of society while they are sick.  Staff them with CNAs who can monitor people and get them hospitalized immediately if they need it.  We are at 10,000 cases a f**ing day and we are doing nothing differently!

For anyone that's interested, here are the results of my survey. I received a total of 1,062 responses from 44 states plus DC, 69 of which were from Florida.

Overall, 49% believe the virus needs to be taken more seriously than it is now, 26% say it is not as serious as they were led to believe, 13% say it was portrayed appropriately and 11% say it was totally overblown. In Florida, 68% of respondents said it needs to be taken more seriously, 32% said it was either totally overblown or that it was less serious than they first believed.

55% say that government needs to do more to address the pandemic. 23% say actions taken went too far, 11% say actions were totally unjustified, and 10% say actions so far have been appropriate. In FL, 64% said more action is needed, compared to 35% who said actions went too far or were totally unjustified.

The Federal govt's response was widely panned, with 80% either strongly or somewhat disapproving vs 14% somewhat or strongly approving. (90 vs 6% in FL). State responses were also underwater generally 56%-37% (74% vs 20% in FL). Local/County responses generally had 45% disapprove, 38% approve, with 17% neutral. In FL, local responses had 57% disapprove, 28% approve, 16% neutral. It is important to note that this does not differentiate between those dissatisfied because they gov't did not do enough and those dissatisfied because the gov't did too much.

Overall, about three quarters of respondents said that wearing a mask (75.6%) and social distancing (76.7%) were somewhat or very important (74% and 81% of Floridians). Similar numbers said that they wear a mask (78.8%) and social distance (76.8%) in public most or all of the time, with the remainder stating that they do them half of the time or less (77% and 86% of Floridians).

A correlation test found that, among other things, there is a strong positive relationship between how serious someone viewed the threat of the virus to be and how important they think that masks and distancing are, although the relationship is slightly less strong between that perception and whether or not they actually do those things. A moderate but significant relationship was found between having more liberal views and having a negative opinion about the federal government's response, as well as placing more importance on masks and distancing.

If anyone has any questions please let me know! If for some reason anyone would like to take a look at my dataset or R code, please send me a DM. Thank you again for your help in this project!",1,1596212682,florida,2020-07-31 12:24:42

A social media post said DeKalb’s COVID-19 call center and testing sites would be close Friday and Saturday. Testing will resume Monday, the post said.

DeKalb was not alone in taking the July 4th weekend off. The North Georgia Health District -- which covers Cherokee, Fannin, Gilmer, Murray, Pickens  and Whitfield counties -- posted that it would be closed too. So did the North Central district surrounding Macon, as well as another district in South Georgia.

It was not immediately clear if other major metro Atlanta counties planned to close up shop. 

A spokesman for the DeKalb Board of Health did not immediately respond to inquiries. 

DeKalb County has the third-highest number confirmed coronavirus cases in Georgia. County officials have been so alarmed by the recent resurgence of cases that they have sent out text messages, voice messages and alerts to hundreds of thousands of county residents this week reminding them of the virus’ “imminent threat.”

“The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in DeKalb and across Georgia,” an alert sent out early Thursday morning said.",1,1593711008,georgia,2020-07-02 13:30:08

CoronavirusGA,boholuxe,Getting accurate and true data concerns and questions,"These are just some of my questions and thoughts as I read the comments, statistics and articles.

First, it seems like testing in Georgia is becoming harder to get in the last 7-14 days, not just because of the holiday but because of testing facilities shutting down or becoming appointment only and could get even harder in the coming weeks which is cause for great concern. 
The “less testing, fewer cases” is insane but the general public will not know this unless they are trying to find testing or local news reports this. We need to stay on top of this for our own, our families and our communities safety.

The ones who have received testing in the last 7-9 days are not receiving their results for 3-12 days so based on this how are we getting an accurate day by day rate? Are they publishing numbers before the 3-12 days people are waiting for their results? 
And the different testing...the up the nose swab versus the throat swab and which one is  more or less accurate and are both numbers part of our daily rates?

Second, I think the only way we will be able to truly see the actual impact on Georgia is the hospitalizations since the deaths can be skewed by data and slow reporting.
In Florida they are not reporting hospitalizations which makes me wonder if we are getting a true rate of hospitalizations? We are getting some on the ground observations that don’t look good, would be a shame to be at “surprise” full capacity next week because of skewed or unpublished data.

Third, deaths. How long is it taking to get deaths correlated with corona? Is it just 24 hours from death to cause to reporting? And what about the huge bump of pneumonia cases etc? How many in total died yesterday in Georgia and of those cases how many has the coroner inspected and death certificates issued? In other words, how are we actually getting accurate death totals daily?",4,1593999477,georgia,2020-07-05 21:37:57

CoronavirusGA,googlyeyes93,Local bar found out Friday night they had a COVID positive patron last week. Still went ahead with big July 4th celebration without closing or letting any staff get tested.,"So exactly like the title says. Popular bar in the Southeast coastal area made a Facebook post Friday night saying they were just informed about a covid positive patient being in the place the previous Sunday. The person apparently sat down and had a few drinks/dinner. Bar said they were going to close and deep clean that night but, surprise, didn’t actually do that and best of all didn’t tell their staff before even making the Facebook announcement. 

They had a huge July 4th bash on Saturday with live music and everything. No distancing, no masks, plenty of videos and pictures on Facebook of everyone there without a care. 

I guess what I’m getting at is, how irresponsible is this on the part of the bar? They had waitstaff and bartenders interacting with this positive patron, possibly get infected, and spread it to who knows how many people in the past week. This is why we’re going to be dealing with this for a long time while the rest of the world moves along.",2,1594016879,georgia,2020-07-06 02:27:59

As of the time of posting this, it has been nearly 24 hours since the last update.

The last time there was a period like this between updates, it was because Gov. Kemp ordered DPH to modify the dashboard so that cases were retroactively added back to the date of test, rather than date of results, in an effort to make the last 14 day numbers appear to decrease so that the stay-at-home order could be lifted (early, by every account everywhere).

At that time we were still reporting the same 500-1000 daily cases we had been since March. Now, as we near 3,000 daily cases, reporting has stopped again.

Yes, we have gotten better at treating this virus in hospitals.

But most of us have known that the flattened death curve was temporary. For the past 3 weeks, we've been watching this new surge of cases move to hospitalizations and then to ICU beds. And now today in Florida (119 deaths) and Arizona (75 deaths) the out-of-control spread is clearly beginning to show up in higher deaths.

We are on the same track in Georgia - let's not kid ourselves. It's a hell of a time to try to send kids back to school. Close the bars now, Governor Kemp!

What's happening is people are getting complacent because they feel like the odds are low that they're going to catch it because it's not being thrown in their face every time they're out. I think people would think twice about going shopping if they had to see a sign about how many people have caught it at the location they're about to go into.

This will not change due to corona due to all of the bars being open and I think you will see a lot of students get peer pressured into going. The 2nd attraction besides bars are the restaraunts that fuel the Athens community. There have already been anonymous reports on the Athens subreddit of restaurants making their employees still come to work while sick and this will further infect. The final factor that I didn’t include because I doubt it will happen but if UGA has one single football game in the fall the coronavirus will take over Athens (don’t think I need to add more to this).

CoronavirusGA,Real-Cupcake8411,Employer Responsibilities,"This is a throwaway account... I don't want to get fired.

Can someone point me to resources about what exactly an employer must do if there is one or more confirmed cases at a workplace? Does it differ state-to-state? If I'm in Augusta (GA), is it different for someone in North Augusta (SC)?

I know they have to be careful about what they share in terms of ADA confidentiality. I see ""guidance"" documents that the employer should speak with the covid-positive employee (in private) to determine who they had ""close contact"" (less than 6' for 15 minutes or more) with and then inform those other employees that they should self-isolate/quarantine for 14 days.

Big Question 1: But do they HAVE to? What if someone tested positive and the employer just sent a general email saying someone tested positive?

It seems criminal for an employer not to tell the people who were in extended close contact with the covid-positive individual(s) who don't realize. There is a world of difference between ""someone tested positive for covid"" and ""you've been identified as a close contact of a covid-positive individual; self-isolate for the next two weeks."" These people are going home to their families!

Question 2: If I know, what are the (legal) consequences if I bypass the usual channels and say something? (For background, it wasn't disclosed to me in the context of medical confidentiality. So not 100%, but sure enough to be appalled that all of us who should be quarantined and not around our kids or parents were not informed.)

Thanks for any insight. What guidance is out there seems to be just that... guidance. I'm hoping there's something more, but am despairing a bit.",13,1595094443,georgia,2020-07-18 13:47:23

CoronavirusGA,StuckInTheUpsideDown,Went to downtown Duluth tonight ... shudder...,"So I've been going to Publix and Costco pretty regularly, and I'm used to see most people wearing masks in the store. I went to downtown Duluth tonight to pick up some takeout and HOLY CRAP. Just a bunch of people wandering around like it's 2019.

There were 6 people (two groups) ahead of me in the takeout line. No one had a mask, and they were all crammed together. I was 6+ feet away, outside in open air, and I still got the heebie-jeebies watching them. Meanwhile a few hundred yards away the outdoor seating area was full of maskless people just hanging out and drinking beer. At least the restaurant employees were masked.

I guess I should expect this, but WTH is wrong with people?",88,1595204837,georgia,2020-07-19 20:27:17

CoronavirusGA,jim1980abc,We need to call our leaders to change the way we tested.,"I was listening this week in virology (Twiv) on episode 640 on ""Test often, fast turnaround"".   They were talking about  how CDC, FDA and/or NIH need to change the test model.    They need to support scale up less accurate but cheap $1 rapid test instead of worrying about more accurate but expensive and long delay PCR tests.  The idea was put forward by Harvard Medical researcher Dr. Mina.

This rapid 5 minute test should be a daily saliva test.  It means to catch transmitted  infected phrase.  Just image we have this daily saliva test with qr code.  Before we go to work place/school, we did this test daily in the morning and upload to result with qr code to an app.  It passed we can go to work/school, otherwise, stay home.

With this test, we can open up school and open up office.

I think this idea is game change and this is first time I feel hopefully about  this epidemic.   We all need to support this idea.

For people who want the better explanation, google Dr. Seheult and medcram on youtube. He just explained the same concept today much clearer with drawing and such.   Thanks @[FourScoreDigital](https://www.reddit.com/user/FourScoreDigital/) to point it out.

Lockdowns kill.

I know of two overdoses and two suicides that happened during the lockdown.

All sorts of death of despair have increased dramatically.

As you decided to close schools the education of an entire generation is being ruined. What impact do you think this will have on their economic future.  Someone's financial and economic situation  is the best indicator for health outcomes during a lifetime. The consequences of your panic will cost other peoples lives.

We should protect the lives of COVID patients, but they are not the only lives worth protecting.

Unfortunately, every number I have found is just a repeating mantra of recorded messages.  Anyone know of a way to get through to a human?

This same school district is forcing all of our children to go back to school in person on August 6th and I certainly don't trust them with their safety.

**Update:** Since i got independent confirmation, I am going to just throw this into the wind. The public deserves to know. I will not divulge my sources as I have heard from multiple members of this school district that any attempt to go to the board has been met with disciplinary action. These people do not deserve to lose their livelihoods and Thomas Moore did not deserve to lose his life due to this man’s possible negligence. Though there is no direct proof of my theory, I want to submit the timeline and the information I have collected from multiple confidential sources.

**UPDATE 2:**

So this spread faster than I expected and I got some new information from someone closer to the circle.  Apparently the admin office goes on a retreat every year and despite it being a PANDEMIC, quite a few ran off together.  The person that provided the information states that they don't believe Rizer is at the core of the outbreak, but they cannot confirm that he was not complicit in the spread or a part of it.  I'm leaving my original timeline up but I will retract my desire to charge Rizer with manslaughter as Thomas Moore did not believe in masks and this cluster may be completely based on a bunch of 'educated' people not believing in science and needing to 'get away.'  If children were in fact INFECTED due to this retreat or perhaps other unsafe behavior, the whole crew should be brought up on charges of criminal negligence and child abuse.

The school is **Houston County High School.**

*Timeline:*

* **June 8th** \- Principal Rizer ordered sanitization for the entire office. No reason given to the staff, no alerts. Custodial services are warned that he was ill but no details were given.  Independent sources say his wife was positive (This detail is now in question).
* **June 19th** – HoCo graduation… No Admins present.  At this point, the news reaches out because they want to know why none of the staff is there.  They admit there was a positive case but won’t say who.  Sources state 5 staff were actually infected, 2 of them hospitalized.  AP Moore works in this office and is married to Thomas Moore.
* **July 6th** – Principal Thomas Moore passes away.  He was a few years retired so should not have been near a school.
* **July 8th** – Football camp is cancelled because of a ‘positive staff member.’ Online sources claim that the Principal’s son was positive and spread it to the football team but I am unsure if he actually did attend the camp.  13 possible cases.  Due to FERPA/HIPAA/Coverup we cannot confirm ANY of those numbers, but multiple people gave similar.

This man continued to come into the office after finding out a family member was ill, claiming he was ‘essential’ even though it is the middle of the summer and technology allows you to WORK FROM HOME.  He hid this information from the staff, never actually alerted the teaching staff itself, and tried to sanitize but still showed up for work.

&amp;#x200B;

**MORE STUFF**

So apparently a lot of these folks are members of Southside Baptist that held an UNMASKED Back The Blue event on June 26th.  

Can you count how many masks you see?  Go ahead and just set this in the timeline.

She comes home, and instead of doing that she’s made a bed in the living room on the floor in front of the tv.  No mask, nothing.  Just made herself comfortable in the living room.

I asked her, “soooo like do you still have the virus,” and she basically said, “yeah I still technically have it, does it make you uncomfortable that I’m out here?”  I told her I was actually uncomfortable and her response is that basically I’m trippin?????

All of this after the fact that when she went to the hospital originally she was in so much pain that she was literally on the floor crying, she had a fever of 108, she had nausea/vomiting/diarrhea for three days, and she blasted EVERYONE on social media for not wearing masks and not social distancing and said, and I quote, “this is the most miserable I’ve ever been in my life, I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.”  

And now that she feels a lil better it’s like fuck the rest of the people that live in this house, she survived so she doesn’t give a fuck.  I don’t really know what to say to her.

CoronavirusGA,jcc211,How do I get my roommate to respect my boundaries regarding Coronavirus?,"Background info: student at UGA living in a house with two roommates. As virus has been picking up throughout GA, and especially Athens, I asked my roommates if they would agree not to have anyone over and if they want to see friends I respect that decision, but please ask that it is not at our house. They agreed and I thought we were on the same page.

Flash forward to tonight: Roommate A works at a bar in dt Athens nearly every night, which makes me uncomfortable, but I just keep my distance and try not to worry about it. Tonight Roommate A returns from work with their significant other (also works at bar). Makes me a little uncomfortable but I am willing to continue keeping my distance and let this slide without conflict. Well about 30 minutes later I hear a lot of noise coming from my kitchen and think it’s pretty loud for just a couple people. I find Roommate A there with significant other and two other bar employees all sitting around without masks. At this point I cover my face with my shirt, quickly grab some snacks, and retreat to my room to try and send a signal that I’m not okay with this. I text and call Roommate A to discretely inform them that I’m uncomfortable with what’s going on, but no response. I also text significant other to let them know that this has gone too far for me and ask that people don’t come over for the time being given the nature of the pandemic. They go to the back porch and then I have an anxiety attack and start disinfecting surfaces and doorknobs.

Has anyone had any similar experience to this and do you have any advice to help resolve this. I hate confrontation and wish my roommate had told their friends not to come over and hadn’t put me in this position where I’m too anxious to ask people I don’t know to leave and also have to wear a mask in my own home to feel safe. I hate that Athens mayor and governor kemp are allowing bars to remain open, which puts people like me at risk who do everything in their power to avoid coronavirus. Sorry this one is long but I just needed to vent I suppose.

TLDR: roommate (works in a bar) agreed not to have anyone over for time being and tonight had a group of coworkers over without masks in our house",1,1595835818,georgia,2020-07-27 03:43:38

If you refuse to wear a mask, we are not friends. 

If you think wearing a mask is uncomfortable, I'm fairly certain you also would not enjoy a ventilator.  Or seeing your family members on one.  

If you are someone who thinks a mask is government control, you need to take off the tin foil hat and have a reality check.  The government has your social security number, your drivers license number, your photo, knows where you live, knows where you work and knows where you take a shit.

As of today, the only offender listed as infected is the prisoner who died a week ago. For the first few days, I assumed they must still be in process of testing. But it still hasn't changed. Does ASMP have exemplary covid management, or are there testing/reporting delays? It looks like inmates are typically getting infected when there have been this many staff infections.

CoronavirusGA,alohamuse,The Public Narrative,"Hey folks. Something I've been chewing on and want to get some feedback.

I am a New York resident and was living in the city during the peak of covid, and was fortunate to experience the collective curve flattening. Coming to Georgia in the last week has been a shock in terms of how I receive state updates (thank goodness for Reddit and this sub).

I'll try not to amplify my bias towards how Cuomo handled the pandemic, because that's no use. What I've noticed, though, is when New York was experiencing the worst, Cuomo's narrative placed our healthcare workers front and center. There was no question as to the state's priority of equipment, PPE, ventilators -- all who bothered to tune in to the readily available daily updates knew our shortage count, updated procurements from vendors, etc. Heck, even general discouragement of masks was happening in New York around March and early April -- not really because of the argument of efficacy -- but because we had a shortage and wanted to route those supplies to medical workers and then other essential workers. The callout, as a workaround, then, was to wear a face covering, and request private businesses pivot towards manufacturing masks for the medical community (and then general public) until further supplies arrived.

It seems like, in Georgia, the population isn't connecting the dots as to *what curve we actually want to flatten*. The train of thought seems to be, ""Well, if my general chances of infection and death are low, then I have nothing to worry about...""; the assumption being the curve we are flattening is case count alone. Contrast this to NY, the train of thought was predominantly, ""Well... I might not get contract covid, but our hospitals are overwhelmed, so that's why we need to flatten the curve."" The narrative always communicated the connection to the medical system and avoiding further stress on it.

Is it just me, or has your experience also been that the general sense of urgency is low because, perhaps, just perhaps, that healthy individuals in GA aren't seeing how we collectively impact the healthcare system?

CoronavirusGA,mitzirose,My first days back as a teacher,"I’m a teacher with many years of experience. I work at a school in a large metro Atlanta county. Students are starting the year digitally. Teachers returned to work this week. All staff are required to be in the building. My school district has a mask mandate. 

Some things I’ve seen:

Some staff members are not following social distancing guidelines. On some occasions, teachers are socializing or working together for extended periods of time at a close distance, at times without a mask. 

Teachers are eating together in groups as large as 6-8 people at different areas of the school. 

All meetings have been in-person with no digital or online meeting options. 

Meetings have been indoors and some are larger than 50 people. Some staff members (including admin, teachers, and support staff) have removed or not worn masks in meetings. 

Social distancing is practiced at some meetings but not at others. 

Masks are not required in shared office spaces despite the school district’s mask mandate. 

Teachers are able to work in their classroom alone. 

During the first few days back for teachers there have been no meetings about safety procedures. 

There is a wide range of adherence to suggested and mandated county, state, and federal guideline and rules from the faculty and staff. 

I’ve heard from teachers at other schools where masks and social distancing are strictly enforced in all shared spaces, meetings are all virtual (or virtual options are given), and socializing or working in-person with others is limited or only available when safety standards can be met. 

It appears that my school district has left safety decisions and mandate enforcement up to individual schools and administrators.",1,1596288287,georgia,2020-08-01 09:24:47

CoronavirusGA,AndreainAtl,Why I wouldn't send a kid to Columbia County schools this week.,"With in-person learning beginning tomorrow in my home county, I thought I'd  take a special look at Columbia County today. Here's why I'd be keeping  my kids home or calling in sick if at all possible this first week, and why I can't imagine CCBOE schools will be in session in a few weeks.

 \#1: Cases are sky high and rising. Harvard Global Health has the most  pro-school opening thresholds of any epidemiology focused group I'm following. Even at HGH, they recommend no in-person learning if the area has more than 25  daily cases per 100,000 residents. In Columbia County, that would be  remote learning if daily cases are 39 or higher. For the first three  months of this epidemic, Columbia County averaged 1-6 daily cases, so well below that threshold. But that's changed in the past month. Cases added each day this week: +53, +67, +74, +50, +54, +55, +71. As of cases  reported out on July 28, according to [an article in the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/31/us/coronavirus-school-reopening-risk.html) this week, Columbia County should expect approximately 1  one percent of the population of students and staff will arrive at  school in Week 1 with COVID-19 infection. At a school of 1,000 that  would be 10 individuals. As of the latest data available, daily  transmissions continue to grow. As of transmissions happening today, 1%  might be more like 1.2% risk.

\#2: Hospitals are full. It's not  just Columbia County. Of all Georgia regions the Augusta area had the  highest number of daily cases per population this week, the second  highest for the past two weeks, and the highest for the past three  weeks. Since July 20, hospitals in the Augusta Region have had [200 or  more COVID patients daily](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/47c1cee4d02542bea35bc3324d6cf5e3) compared to 30-60 most of 2020. University &amp; Summerville are the only Augusta hospitals who regularly [report  their diversion status to GAEMS](https://gaems.net/cgi-bin/diversion.pl). Both have been rotating daily through  diversions for ICU or ER or both for several weeks now. 

\#3: In  addition to opening too early, CCBOE isn't following best practices  inside of its buildings. I just read over CCBOE's Google Doc Updated  [Return to School Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11iWsqGwlO6QLGzRG1oEshH7lSK-v3BuY7IgJlrm-u-I/edit). Lots of talk about handwashing and cleaning  surfaces. But in 15 pages, there's not a single mention of hvac,  filtration or air purifiers. The word window is only used in reference  to a quarantine window. Masks are not only optional for students inside  classrooms, but also for teachers inside classrooms. By the county plan,  classes like chorus and band will still be happening despite the extra  risk they create. Although the district plan now encourages schools to  do things like stagger starts and deliver bag lunches to classrooms, the  district plan doesn't require it. I don't see any reference to  decreasing interactions between students by creating learning pods like  many small and private schools are doing.

\#4: Reopening at this  time and in this manner isn't sustainable. As of the last reporting  data, Columbia County employees 700 secondary school teachers. They are all likely to spend at least two hours this week in an enclosed space  with 1-2 infected approximately adult sized persons. I'd expect 35-70  infections among secondary school teachers this week. Those infections will significantly reduce  available teachers. (Even those not seriously ill due to quarantine  requirement.) If an infected teacher was in a faculty meeting, then it's  an even bigger staff outage for quarantine. Everpresent is the lower  but much more serious risk a staff meeting becomes a super spreader  event. With COVID's high hospitalization rate, 35-70 infected teachers  would likely mean 3-7 additional hospitalizations. Although students are  unlikely to be hospitalized if infected, if 3% of students are  infected, that likely means another 226 adults in Columbia County  infected, or another 23 hospitalizations. And that's Week 1.",1,1596404929,georgia,2020-08-02 17:48:49

To know that he is not going to be in the picture with all of his classmates in front of school this morning. I feel so conflicted and he is an angry, bitter teenager because of all of this.

I get the science behind my situation, so why don't the community leaders. We live in Candler county and they literally are acting like NOTHING is happening here. There is no a/b scheduling, no required masking, and no social distancing. I feel like I am living in an alternate universe.

Following that I would be wondering why we need to employ PE coaches at all.

I mean really any person watching the news in the right state of mind isn’t attending a high school football game.We now have kids on football teams in our state testing positive.

They are very small and can social distance the kids but are not requiring masks. They really hate the idea of possibly going to online school if it gets worse. I’m afraid they won’t be transparent about possible exposures and illnesses if they come up. Are they really able to do whatever they want even if kids there get sick? Anyone know what they can legally do  and not do in that regard? They are not a charter by the way.

My mom says its not safe and I should stay home, but I haven't been getting along with her since quarentine started and I'm ready to go.

Why do so many people HATE science? People here HATE you for wearing a mask and hate anyone who will politely ask them to. Honestly this pandemic has made me hate everyone around me and lose faith in people, my state as a whole, and all of our ""leaders"". It's definitely taking a toll on my mental health- not from being stuck in the house as the federal government will tell you- but because of what I am seeing coming from the people in power and the people around me.

I told them the limited liability laws granted to institutions wouldn't cover their asses for this gross negligence and reckless endangerment. My son is home today, he will be withdrawn and we will be doing DL from here on out.

CoronavirusGA,DichotomyGirl,Barrow County to go all Digital Learning,"  

**Barrow County School System will start the school year with distance learning for all students on Monday, August 17, 2020.**

The health and well-being of our students, families and staff must be our top priority. Although the district had planned to begin with both in-person and distance learning, the current COVID-19 situation required a change in those plans. “It was our sincere desire to welcome students back into schools for in-person learning. We know that students learn best inside a traditional classroom. We are attempting to make that happen while keeping student and staff safety at the forefront,” said Superintendent McMichael.

“We made a very difficult decision based on the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in our county, as well as the concerns over being able to appropriately staff our schools.” Dr. McMichael continued, “If today was the first day of school, we would have been hard-pressed to have sufficient staff available to open our schools.” Although every precaution was taken and each staff member was required to wear a mask during preplanning, over 90 BCSS staff have had to quarantine due to a confirmed case of COVID-19, a suspected case, or direct contact with a confirmed case, and this is before students returned to our buildings.

We understand the difficulties that 100% online learning will cause for families. We are focused on providing the best instruction possible for our students. More information will be shared on Friday, Aug 7th about Chromebook requests and distribution, meals, and other important information. The district will also present a phased approach to bring students back into the classrooms as quickly as possible. Schools will share updated plans for orientation and preparation for online learning.

The data that Johns Hopkins is curating is a cumulative count of cases and deaths for all counties in the USA.  You can find that data on their GitHub page at:

[https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

I wrote code that **converts the Johns Hopkins timeseries \*cumulative\* counts into \*daily\* counts of cases and deaths for all counties**.  These daily counts begin March 24th and are in csv files that anyone can download and import into GIS or spreadsheet software.  I made a PDF with details about (1) the interactive map and (2) these csv files.

Instead of getting their employees to get tested they said they're fine and can keep coming into work. When I heard this, I was very worried. They had seemed to be doing their best but they apparently don't care about their staff. Especially since Idaho is one of the states that is having a lots of cases everyday. I find this to be very irresponsible on their part. Why not close down and get everyone tested before coming back? Wouldn't that be the smart thing to do? I can only imagine how their employees feel having to come in everyday to act like everything is just fine. I understand that they are a buisness and need to keep the place going but if everyone gets Covid, they won't have a business for a lot longer then just 14 days.

Schools will need extra staff to fill in for sick or quarantined teachers, and to accommodate smaller class sizes. Phy ed teachers could be a huge asset there with subs in short supply.

Instruction time will be in short supply, too, at middle and high with changes to passing periods and the need to clean between classes.

CoronavirusIllinois,LacrimaeRerum,On interpreting Chicago case numbers,"Happy 4th, everyone! Hope things are chill. 

I've been lurking here for a while and recently I've a lot of arguing about whether or not there's a spike in Chicago cases. This got me curious so I decided to look into the data. I suspect the source of the confusion is that the Chicago covid dashboard is, uh, not very easy to interpret, to put it charitably. My goal is here is to describe how I understand the dashboard. 

DISCLAIMER: I take no stance on what the optimal lockdown policy should be. I just live in Illinois and like to mess with data. 

So you open the dashboard and probably the first thing your eyes will be drawn to is the ""Current daily averages for Citywide"" panel, here: 

https://i.imgur.com/Y7b8S3u.png

There are two things to keep in mind about this panel: 

1. These numbers are 7-day moving averages. That is, what's being reported are the average positivity rate, case count, and test count for a 7-day period; every day they add in the latest day and drop the earliest day. 
2. More importantly there is a lag in these numbers. That is, the numbers that you see if you open the dashboard on July 3rd are actually the 7-day averages from June 22-June 28, NOT from June 28-July 3. 

If you want to compute 7-day averages using the most up-to-date numbers, what you have to do is look at the ""Cumulative totals for Citywide"" panel here: 

https://i.imgur.com/mcXRPgX.png

By changing the date range on the left hand side, you can get the total number of cases and tests conducted as of each day. With a spreadsheet or something, you can then subtract each day's numbers from the previous day to get the number of new cases and tests. I did this with some recent data and got the following: 

https://i.imgur.com/8Lyo3bG.png

Column 1 is the date. Column 2 is the number of total cases on that date. Column 3 is the number of total tests on that date. Column 4 (dc) is the first-difference of the number of cases between that day and the previous data; that is, it's the number of **new** cases reported on that day. Column 5 (dt) is the same thing but with tests. Column 6 (pos) is the percent positive on that day, calculated simply as dc/dt. Column 7 (7dma-%pos) is the 7-day average of test positivity, calculated as the average of pos for the previous 7 days. Note that this starts on 6/28 because you need 7 days' worth of data to compute a 7 day average, obviously. Columns 8 and 9 are the same thing but for numbers of cases and tests respectively. 

What does this mean? Take a look at the 7-day averages for 6/28 in the spreadsheet, and compare them with the posted averages for 7/3 on the Chicago dashboard. You'll see that the numbers match up- 4.7% positive, 182 cases, and 3885 tests. So, we can be pretty confident that we've cracked the code--Chicago is (correctly) reporting the 7-day moving averages, but with a 1-week lag. 

What does this mean going forward? Looking at the spreadsheet for dates 6/29-7/2, it does look like positivity is increasing somewhat over this period. Whether this will change in the future because of weird data nonsense I'm not sure. How you want to interpret this is up to you, but hopefully this will help clear up some confusion.

Do you gain some kind of neurochemical social reward for it? Are you just afraid that somebody's going to give you s*** for not wearing a mask, sneezing, or not sanitizing your hands or some s***? Why do I see posts about people worried about segregating train cars into people wearing and not wearing masks? You realize that part of the mask that doesn't seal against your face (at the top) allows virus particles to drop right in and go up your nose? All it takes is 1 viron. Did you realize that goggles are actually more essential than a mask? Did you realize that the face guard at McDonald's that you bump your face into when you try to use your card was bumped into by everybody else's faces, effectively transmitting about any virus that any of them had on their skin? No you don't think about that s***. And that's why you're pawns in this game. Not even pawns really. Kind of like ""not even being wrong"". Pawn of a pawn. The square it's upon. Do you realize a false sense of security you have established with your silly, entrained, antihygenic hygiene-habit is actually worse for you when a bio-weapon is intentionally released? You're all spreading a whole lot of nothing right now, but when you're really spreading something that's REALLY SOMETHING you'll REALLY be spreading it. That's probably what they're training you for. They need it to spread effectively when they actually release it to the public. I'm not saying THIS virus doesn't exist. They're just using the overinflation of it as a tool for something.

Not an exact quote, but the Superintendent said something along the lines of “Our students will have struggle learning, and our teachers will have difficulty teaching, if they are dead.”

Never though Plainfield of all places would come through with such a win. I hope they become leaders locally. 

To me it’s a win win. If cases break out from schools starting, it looks smart cause they protected their students and staff.  If cases don’t break out, they still took care of their students and staff.

CoronavirusIllinois,WheezySea,gossip: St Louis Metro East out of regular hospital beds,"A friend of a friend with COPD had a bad day, needed hospitalization in a regular bed, and had to be taken to Springfield, which was the nearest one. My friend follows the sites I do, which say we have plenty of ICU headroom. So she phoned StLU, Alton Memorial, and asked ""do you have regular hospital rooms?"" They answered her. ""No, not a room. We've had people waiting in ERs for a long time waiting to be admitted."" The doctor told the patient that Christian NE, St. Anthony's, and Barnes were full, which my friend totally doubted until she made the calls.

My sister worked at Christian for 15 years, and never were all the beds taken. 

So... maybe we should be asking about regular hospital headroom, not just ICU? 

My friend has no idea why the beds are full. It must not be all Covid (people have heart attacks, strokes, car wrecks, etc.)  And they did push off elective surgery until recently, so maybe it's that.

Still, not reassuring. Not with the 7.1% positivity rate in the region.

On Tuesday, I stepped down because my sister isn't wanting people to wear masks. I am considering attending the ceremony as a guest, masked, and then leaving immediately afterwards. This wedding is going to have 180 people in attendance. I refuse to go to the reception or take pictures or anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I go, the ceremony is outdoors. I will be masked and maintain an appropriate distance. However, if I go, my partner wants me to quarantine away from our home for 14 days. I was tested for COVID last Monday due to a dry cough, but I came back negative. When I had my test, I was told that I could be tested 4-5 days after exposure, which would mean I could get tested next Wednesday and, provided I come back negative, I could come home. He says that he isn't comfortable with this and would want me away for a full 14 days.   


Now, due to me stepping down from the wedding, my family has basically cut me off... so I can't exactly stay with my parents during this quarantine, not to mention the fact that they're going to be exposed at a WAY higher risk than I will, between hair and makeup, pictures, reception, etc, so I'd have to get a hotel or an airbnb... Which is expensive. 4-5 days, I could do... but 14? Probably not... 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I feel like quarantine is really necessary if I'm masked and maintain distance... How is that really any different than going to a park? But I need to respect my partner's feelings on it.

"" As families and policymakers make decisions about their children returning to school, it is important to consider the full spectrum of benefits and risks of both in-person and virtual learning options.  Parents are understandably concerned about the safety of their children at school in the wake of COVID-19.  The best available evidence indicates if children become infected, they are far less likely to suffer severe symptoms.[\[1\]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/reopening-schools.html#fn1),[\[2\]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/reopening-schools.html#fn2),[\[3\]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/reopening-schools.html#fn3) Death rates among school-aged children are much lower than among adults.  At the same time, the harms attributed to closed schools on the social, emotional, and behavioral health, economic well-being, and academic achievement of children, in both the short- and long-term, are well-known and significant.  Further, the lack of in-person educational options disproportionately harms low-income and minority children and those living with disabilities.  These students are far less likely to have access to private instruction and care and far more likely to rely on key school-supported resources like food programs, special education services, counseling, and after-school programs to meet basic developmental needs.[\[4\]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/reopening-schools.html#fn4) ""

The data that Johns Hopkins is curating is a cumulative count of cases and deaths for all counties in the USA.  You can find that data on their GitHub page at:

[https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

I wrote code that **converts the Johns Hopkins timeseries \*cumulative\* counts into \*daily\* counts of cases and deaths for all counties**.  These daily counts begin March 24th and are in csv files that anyone can download and import into GIS or spreadsheet software.  I made a PDF with details about (1) the interactive map and (2) these csv files.

Denmark and Norway had success while Israel and Sweden did not.  All countries had the virus relatively under control when they opened their schools.  There is also some data suggesting that very few outbreaks were reported in daycares that stayed open in the US.

Denmark:
Denmark had younger students back first, separate lunch, small groups, masks and hand washing.  They did not have to close any schools to deal with one case, they had no outbreaks in their schools.  Eventually they brought older kids back to school.

Norway:
Took similar steps to Denmark and had similar success.  
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-schools-rekindled-epidemic-norway.html

Israel:
They reopened schools with safety precautions then within weeks relaxed the small class sizes. After they relaxed the precautions they had outbreaks in schools.  They had 244 positive tests from students and staff in schools.

Day care centers stayed open in the US with very few outbreaks in those places according to data compiled by 
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/how-sweden-wasted-rare-opportunity-study-coronavirus-schools

Data and Conclusion from France study: 
- 2% of infected kids got sick
- Children 10 and under don’t transmit as well, - High School kids had 40% infection rate while with 6 elementary schools in the community only 9% of kids got infected and 7% of the teachers.
- No evidence students infected other people.
Conclusion: Opening elementary schools is safer than opening Jr High and High Schools.

I have seen a bunch of people talking about testing recently. I would like to make a suggestion that would be helpful for others.  When anyone talks about testing turn around time it would be helpful to people reading who are trying to find a good testing location to provide additional anecdotal information.

I'm open to ideas, but I think a few key details should be in every post or reply.  Those details are:

1) Specimen sample collection location

2) Date of specimen collection

3) Name of the provider (if applicable)

4) Name of the lab (If known)

5)  Post this link or the link to a good provider network [https://dph.illinois.gov/testing](https://dph.illinois.gov/testing) 

I think this would be helpful for people in your geographic area that seeking out testing, but do not always have a PCP and are unsure of how to get a test in a quick time frame. I'm open to others' input on the format as this is a half-baked post.  And as always, this:  [https://dph.illinois.gov/testing](https://dph.illinois.gov/testing)

CoronavirusIllinois,broomryderwon,Mask + Trauma = possible panic attack when you’d least expect it.,"Typically I am fine with disposable masks, I still have my moments but am able to control them. Today I wore a very cute mask that my bfs mom had made for me. Very thoughtful of her. I decided to try it out while shopping at Walmart. Turns out this mask ended up feeling a little bit too close to home of being suffocated. I started to panic, my son was with me &amp; didn’t want to worry him just wanted to leave before the attack got too bad. It began taking me to places I didn’t want to be and had to finally tell my son something was very wrong that we need to switch masks and leave the store right away. My panic attacks come at very random times &amp; this was the start of one I wasn’t going to be able to control. We walked as far away as possible to not be around anyone before changing masks and running out. A lady started to yell at me &amp; I just ignored her &amp; began leaving. Thoughts on handling it any other way? I don’t want to make people uncomfortable or think I’m doing something just to be ignorant... but I didn’t think I’d make it out the door without getting the mask off. I had an unfortunate tragic situation happen in my life &amp; some things trigger it... feeling like I’m being suffocated, again, is one. I still have to shop &amp; go places but I do feel bad about that indecent. This new norm of life can be so tough.

Yes the charts at a first glance look bad to me. It looks like we're using very little ICU beds, and a TOOON of ventilators being used.

However, it was the opposite we're using very little ventilators and a great deal of ICU beds.

There's no color coordination and it should be at a moment's notice clear the direction of the state.

CoronavirusIllinois,MGoDuPage,Unconfirmed (But Credible) Rumor: Feds Seize Coronavirus Test Kits Bound For Illinois,"Thread title says it all.

I haven't seen this break in the news yet, but here's the credible (IMO) rumor that's relevant to this subreddit:

My wife is a physician who works at a hospital that is in one of the larger private health care service provider hospital/clinic networks in Illinois.  She said today her hospital sent out an e-mail notice that a big shipment of coronavirus testing kits that was slated to be delivered either the hospital network or to the State of Illinois itself (it was unclear to me which one she meant), was instead seized by the federal government &amp; redirected to the southern states.  


Bottom line: the seizure is likely to greatly diminish community testing capacity in certain areas of Illinois for the time being. Her example:  instead of testing all patients that show up at a hospital ER regardless of reason for visit, they will go back to only testing patients who are bad enough to admit into the hospital or who are coming in for a scheduled hospital procedure. Her words: ""basically going back to testing availability as it was back in March or April.""

If true &amp; if widespread, the practical impact for people Illinois is it may quickly spike the % positivity rate as a metric. In this case, not necessarily because the raw # of cases is skyrocketing, but rather the testing capacity is being materially diminished because tests being ordered by state &amp; local officials, (and also potentially large private healthcare provider networks) are being seized by the federal government &amp; sent to other states.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much for EVERY disease, we as a society, have selected a certain number of deaths for a certain disease is acceptable. Shitty way of saying it. But we accept that X amount die from the flu, X amount die from cancer, etc. 

At this point, COVID has a very high rate compared to others. But at the same time, it has come down significantly over the last few months. As the months goes on, I’m sure it will drop even more. At some point it will bottom out and flatten and we can come to a pretty reliable number.  What number do you think is acceptable?  Again shitty to say any deaths are acceptable, but like I said, with every illness/disease, we have always accepted a certain amount of deaths as “normal”.

After previously official 7 day delayed 7 day averaged downward biased sample date based Positivity reached 5.9% yesterday (7/29) and with the more timely and less downward biased alternative report date positivity, advocated by this author, coming in at 6.4% on 7/29.

https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/sites/covid/reports/2020-07-30/Chicago_COVID-19_Update_V8_7.30.2020.pdf

&gt; *Please note: Beginning on 7/30/2020, percent positivity is calculated based on number of tests conducted rather than number of people tested, to align with IDPH practices

This embrace of supposed consistency with IDPH methodology certainly comes with convenient timing, dropping the “official” positivity from 5.9% to 4.6% in a single day. A whopper of a drop adding an extra 1.3% comfy buffer from a dreaded 7% positivity level that has been mentioned as a threshold for more mitigation measures.

&gt;As of July 30, 2020, there have been 598,356 tests performed. The 7-day average is 6,899 tests per day, with a percent positivity of 4.6%*.

This new found embrace of consistency with IDPH hasn’t extended to utilizing report date based calculations as IDPH does and dropping the 7 day delay, a delay ascribed to the need to accumulate results for a prior 7 day window os sample dates. The fast turn around of test results would eliminate the problem of any large discrepancy between sample and result date analysis, however test turn around time has been increasing nationwide.

The timely change in methodology also ignores a glaring inconsistency with much of the rest of the state in regards to the numerical difference between new persons tested and new tests, the much higher re-testing level compared to other counties in Illinois, with a typical 20-25% of all tests performed in Chicago each day being on individuals already been tested previously. The high concentrations in Chicago of the healthcare heroes from Chicago’s world class medical district and powerhouse hospitals who would need frequent testing to keep them and their patients safe, and especially to avoid spread amongst staff, is likely a significant contribution to the roughly 2,000 re-tests performed on a daily basis in the city of broad shoulders. 

It’s notable that in the discussion and comments of this author’s previous posts, highlighting what appears to be an accelerating recent abrupt rise in result date positivity by person tested, multiple astute redditors had observed that IDPH uses the terminology of tests while Chicago reports the total number of persons tested. Clearly counting individuals who retake tests in the denominator of Positivity will lower that measure. 

The coincidence of timing of Chicago deciding to covert to tests for the report issued today after well informed and civilized discussion by all parties the day prior on this sub, is surely just that, a coincidence. 

However we await eagerly to see if another possible coincidence, the interactive dashboard found at:

https://chi.gov/coviddash

Which has not been updated yet for 7/30,   something which has admittedly happened on other Fridays, will continue to provide access to the total number of “Persons” tested. Fears of useful information being dropped shouldn’t be seen as unfounded given the daily report PDF had quietly dropped the cumulative number of tests administered. 

With 380 new cases reported in a 24 hour period, perhaps the biggest issue facing the CDPH might be what to do if 7 day average daily cases reach the 405/day level in the city. With 2.7 million residents this level would be equivalent to the level at which the city has been issue quarantine orders for travelers return from states with 7 day average new cases greater than 15 per 100k of population. 

The real heart of the problem is actually - what is Rt right now? 

https://rt.live/us/IL

RT.live is estimating Illinois is at 1.10 currently. The problem with this virus is runaway exponential contagion. By definition when Rt is greater than 1 the contagion process is an exponential function, the larger it is above 1 the more rapid the doubling rate is. Before the US implemented stay at home orders the doubling time was a shocking 3 days or less based on how rapid deaths began to accumulate. A rate that was remarkably consistent worldwide in many countries.

The focus on Positivity rate is something very logical. Rt isn’t something easy to observe but a positivity rate with the characteristics of testing policy and accessibility held constant is a good proxy. The exact numerical relationship between Rt and positivity in a stable testing regime is unknown but there seems to be a hunch expressed recently by Dr Birx that right around 5% is a critical level:

&gt; “When you first see that increase in test positivity, that is when to start the mitigation efforts,” Birx said in the recording. “I know it may look small and you may say, ‘That only went from 5 to 5-and-a-half [percent], and we’re gonna wait and see what happens.’ If you wait another three or four or even five days, you’ll start to see a dramatic increase in cases.”

https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/07/white-house-advisor-dr-birx-calls-on-cleveland-other-cities-to-take-aggressive-steps-to-stem-coronavirus-spread-report-says.html

The dramatic increase is that snowballing of the exponential process as Rt crosses 1.

As many readers of this sub will certainly do, keeping a close eye on indicators will help families and business plan for potential changes in restrictions. As Chicago reports new cases and hopefully new tests and persons tested each day those results to span a range of previous dates when the samples where collected, however they are the most recent data and therefore the newest information.

So we finally heard back on my previous post about my fiance's unemployment. Denied! Can be appealed and claim PUA at the same time apparently.

So for 2 months they held her claim in limbo just in time for the extended benefits to expire and then they deny her claim. She never received a call to discuss or anything. The website mentions they apparently ""discussed"" with her previous employer (and who knows when since you know this took 2 months) and determined it to not be a wrongful termination because fuck people &gt; corporate. She also never received a call-back from that stupid queue system. We only got this information after both of us repeatedly emailed our house, state, and governor representatives.

All that back-pay that we were waiting and hoping for is now gone. I doubt an appeal will work and the PUA I bet can not be back-dated since Illinois sat on their ass waiting to handle this claim.

Is it possible to sue the government for this much negligence? We were already looking at talking with a lawyer for her wrongful termination against the employer. This is unacceptable and makes me furious!",1,1596204964,illinois,2020-07-31 10:16:04

I know some of our dashboards we share here include US numbers, just curious.

&gt; Myself [and others have noticed some ""irregularities"" in reported case counts recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Digital_Manipulation/comments/hzg8y5/the_white_house_and_hhs_may_be_cooking_the/).  It appears to have started right around the time the White House insisted that hospitals report numbers to HHS rather than the CDC -- around July 13-16.  

&gt; Trends for states suddenly changed right around that time, and reported daily cases that were rapidly increasing suddenly went flat for multiple days and often dropped afterward.  The shape of the case curve doesn't fit what we've seen before: usually public health measures gradually bend the curve, they don't suddenly change trends overnight. [This change is most visible when looking at the 7 day averages for new daily cases](https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&amp;highlight=California&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right-12wk#states-normalized).  Additionally there are discrepancies in the before vs. after behavior for specific states depending on the political affiliation of the states.   **To people familiar with how real-world data behaves, this looks suspicious, and it seems to reduce the number of reported cases vs what we'd expect from the trend before this.  The timing is also suspicious.**

&gt; I wonder if they'll ask the public health experts about the switch in reporting cases to HHS rather than the CDC?   I hope someone has enough experience working with data to question them about this... what could it mean?

&gt;Edit: It looks like the video in the link above was made private, but here are a couple key slides taken from it:

Chicago recently averages 32% of it’s daily tests are re-tests of previously tested individuals. This is a significant and unusual fraction. 

A change of methodology on 7/30 resulted in a drop of their “official” positivity from 6.0% to 4.6% after including individuals being re-tested by switching to tests administered. 

https://imgur.com/a/Xd65JqM

Keep in mind this official positivity is also 7 days delayed as it is a sample date measure and recent sample dates will not have returned results. Roughly 50% of results have recently been received within 5 days of sample collection. 

Tests are used by IDPH and for most geographic areas People and Tests will not be as large a difference. Additionally IDPH does not use sample
date metrics but result date metrics that do not involve any delays or lags. 

These posts will report alternative result date metrics that utilize the most recent new information. A short 3-day average helps to smooth weekend and daily variations. 

Going forward I will keep the nightly reporting short and without a detailed description. The terminology used will be “people positivity” to distinguish and labeled with (alt metrics) to denote these are not CDPH endorsed metrics, however they are based on their official data. 

Note: currently you will need to trust my reporting of People tested as the cumulative tally was removed from the dashboard, starting today 7/31. However I as an individual still have access to this data. How to provide verification of the number has not been determined at this point.

Some additional background can be found in yesterday’s post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusIllinois/comments/i12sh7/chicago_730_380_new_cases_nearing_405day_level/

The purpose of this alternative metrics is not to challenge CDPH, we are all on the same team, we want to defeat this virus. Instead it’s because I strongly believe the result date metrics are more timely and actually more accurate. Last weeks alt metrics accurately predicted the 6% lagged sample date metrics this week. The CDPH sample date metrics from 7 days ago will constantly be revised upward and backward adjusted. However it turns out the local average of result date metrics is actually an excellent predictor of the final sample date metric when 45 days later all tests for that date have been received. There are statistical reasons for that which are beyond the scope of this post, so unfortunately that also requires some trust for now.",1,1596256748,illinois,2020-08-01 00:39:08

Our school system just did a survey asking whether people would send their kids back to school as normal, do e-learning, or homeschool.  

Almost 70% are planning to send their kid back to school.  10% e-learning, 5% homeschool, rest undecided.  

I understand that not everybody has options here, but I really expected the numbers to be different in our county.  Personally we're going to homeschool my grade school kid for a year.  We feel that since we can it is our duty to so that other kids that have to go back have more space with less kids around them.

CoronavirusIndiana,Makebot_Robotics,Introducing India's First SMART Mask for your society,"Health is like money. We never have a true idea of its value until we lose it. Health needs solid, safe walls of protection &amp; needs to be cared for in a smarter way. To be noted that you will survive with all these restrictions &amp; protections, but you may or may not survive corona infection. Prevention is better than cure. Therefore, facemasks have become both essential and, most times, scarce over the course of the last few months. With the continuing need to encourage and local governments, requiring people to wear face coverings when they go out in public, the production of facemasks has been thrusted into one of the high-demand services. As a result, brands both big and small have launched into action, pivoting their production facilities and typical products to create and sell facemasks to meet the surge in demand.

The World Health Organization estimates it will require 89 million medical masks every month throughout the pandemic. To meet that demand, a 40% increase in manufacturing is both needed and expected.

And while many consumers expect the larger manufacturing companies to increase the production of medical masks, a fresh wave of brands, which consumers may not have expected, have begun the creation of face masks for the everyday person. The reasons for this influx of brands now creating face masks varies — with motivations tied to social responsibility, increasing brand awareness and finding new advertising platforms. Regardless, these mask-producing companies are undoubtedly contributing to the rise in face mask availability across the country.

And now we've got a face mask too but its not just a face mask it’s a SMART Mask i.e. latest state of art mask made by Makebot, an Ed. Tech company, which shall provide safety, ease of comforts to users with an intelligent platform to generate alert SMSs. It's user-friendly, reliable, trusted, environment friendly and durable.

Smart Mask is India’s first mask, which offers an intelligent platform to capture various health parameters like temperature, SPO2 and Arogya Setu status through endpoint devices and keep a track of one's health. In case of any deviation, the platform sends alerts in the form of SMS to the specified user.

India’s first Smart Mask, which will provide safety, comfort and an intelligent platform to proactively monitor the health of your loved ones. Smart Mask is integrated with a technology platform designed and developed by Makebot to monitor the health of people and send alerts.

Smart Mask ensure that person will be safe in any environment whether it’s a society, corporates, manufacturing plants or any industry. Smart Mask provide exceptional quality &amp; comfort for the user and it can stand 30 hand washes\*

Dual respirator in Smart Mask removes carbon dioxide build-up inside the mask and releases stale air. This allows the user to inhale more oxygen and feel comfortable even for long hours, especially for the kids and the aged people, as dual respirators are very beneficial for the aged ones who deal with asthma and other respiratory problems.

Why Societies should use SMART Mask?

• Helps societies to comply with unlocking guidelines

• Ensure every person should wear a face mask

• Maintains the record of maids, staff, drivers etc. while entering &amp; exiting

• Society Logo – For easy identification

• Provide dashboard and alerts for analysis

• Reinstate confidence and normality

I'm trying to help my friend, who is overwhelmed by many other things at the moment, find some way for her kid to not have to go back to school in Indiana.

She is in 6th grade, and is a super-smart kid in REACH classes. My friend does not want to send her kid back to school, but there are no remote-learning options available for her kid that wouldn't be 2 or 3 grade levels behind where her learning is at currently. The district is not doing any remote-learning for REACH kids, and she's being told if her kid doesn't show up to school they will drop her from REACH and she won't be able to get back in until next calendar year, if that (requires re-testing and they didn't have testing this year due to covid).

My friend is at very high risk for covid, and is panicked. She's set letters to her school board, local representatives, etc. She has gotten no response, except for dismissive ones that focus on the small % of kids that are involved in REACH classes, so they aren't allocating resources there. Does anyone have any suggestions for how she might handle this? Are there suitable online education options that Indiana will recognize for school credit that anyone is aware of? Any assistance is greatly appreciated. Thanks, and stay safe out there!",8,1595216472,indiana,2020-07-19 23:41:12

Coronavirus_KY,cladius_galen,Inconsistency between state and local numbers explanation,"Someone mentioned my username on the June 17 post because the gov answered a lot of the questions I had. I don’t recall who you were but thanks. I keep seeing this pop up on daily updates as a question so I went back and copied the answer he gave about why the numbers seem off. I hope this helps some of you guys and won’t have to go digging! If I interested it’s the 3rd to last question on the June 17,2020 update.


Question:
Can I explain how reporting works and explain the discrepancies between local and state-level numbers? 

-- We did this a long time ago and I’m not sure if we still have the graph showing where we were getting all our testing info from. It’s getting better because it’s become more automated but we have over 40 labs that are doing some form of testing in KY. We send them the regulation on how they are supposed to report, but it doesn't mean they always do. And so we continually have to remind them they have to send, first, all their positives, and then also the number of negative tests as well. Sometimes the providers provide them to the local health departments instead and then we get that information from the local departments. Sometimes we get it from both, but the info is written differently and so it’s hard to see the duplicates. For hospital beds/ICUs, that’s data provided by the hospitals themselves. Now that’s good data since it’s them putting it in, but it’s only good enough as the person inputting that information and how often they are inputting that information. There is a lot of room for error here because there are a lot of users that are out there and they are all pouring their information in. Yes we have seen errors on the state level but also on the local level because they are dealing with this as well.",1,1594429639,kentucky,2020-07-10 21:07:19

* New deaths by county: 72 F Shelby, 77 M Floyd, 89 F Casey, 44 F Carter, 82 M Ohio, 65 M Fayette
* Dr. Stack: The CDC released a new report about 2 hair stylists in Springfield, Missouri that both tested positive. [During that time they wore masks (as required by regulations in their city) while serving their 139 clients and not a single person that got their hair cut tested positive](https://imgur.com/Wb5fjAz).
* KYSAFER hotline has been reactivated (1-833-KYSAFER). You can use this number to report rules and regulations not being followed. 
* Question about today’s hearings of the legislature -- Yesterday it appeared people were going to wear masks and Yesterday evening a state senator, we will respect his privacy, tested positive for COVID-19 who had been in the hearings. [But today we had almost every member of one political party's representatives and senators not wearing masks and not staying 6ft apart](https://imgur.com/XUFrAK8). &lt;more below&gt; I didn’t take this picture, they posted it themselves. We are in a life and death battle, you can’t be doing that.
* Question on visitation in nursing homes, has the guidance in that area changed with the recent spike? -- We are still moving ahead with the visitation but there are a number of safeguard in effect. If we find there is spread through that then we will have to look at it. The fact we are testing everyone in long-term care facilities gives us some comfort and now we are moving to testing staff.
* Question on testing -- Kroger is free to the public. The others are supposed to be but it doesn’t always work out that way because we have insurance, medicaid, many different types of payers out there. We have worked to eliminate other barriers to provide tests at little to no cost. &lt;more below&gt;
* Questions about calls WPFL has received regarding employers that won’t pay employees when they have tested positive and/or are requiring certain procedures if you want to go and get tested. What are we doing to make sure the right incentives are in-place? -- It is incredibly short-sighted for a business to not offer paid leave to someone who has this virus because otherwise someone desperate isn’t going to tell you, they will go to work and infect your workforce so instead of paying 1 person for 14 days you could lose your entire workforce. That is just not smart business. It also means that business is not safe to the public so I hope everyone by now is doing paid leave in those situations. We have pushed for that. I heard that some employers are requiring permission before getting tested. Your employer cannot dictate your healthcare decisions, if you want to get tested and your employer is trying to stop you then call us here at state government and we will talk to them

**Summarized (Full) Notes**

* It’s 4 o’clock, on this Tuesday, the time we come together everyday to get an update on the coronavirus which continues to surge in the commonwealth. We have had many instances in our past of the country being under attack and this is no different, COVID-19 is attacking us and we are at war with this virus. It’s time to stop the silliness and the games and it’s time to live up to our morals. We either come together or we fall apart. Team Kentucky means us coming together and practicing social distancing and wearing a mask. Today we have the second highest number of cases. This virus isn’t playing and neither are we. We wear a mask to protect people like David &lt;talked about in a previous update&gt; and he is here with his parents today. They want to talk about how important it is that we wear masks. 
* [David talks](https://youtu.be/6ygVGPeBN9o?t=350) about wearing masks. “I wear a mask to protect other people and so should you”
* Governor takes back over:
* If you don’t want to wear a mask for me then that’s fine but surely you will wear one for so many children around this commonwealth that are counting on you. Every leader, it is time for you to wear a mask. All the experts agree. Our economy will suffer and lives will be lost if you don’t. Case studies are coming out that say masks will help protect our small businesses. I’m going to have Dr. Stack come up and talk.
* Dr Stack:
* The CDC released a new report about 2 hair stylists in Springfield, Missouri that both tested positive. [During that time they wore masks (as required by regulations in their city) while serving their 139 clients and not a single person that got their hair cut tested positive](https://imgur.com/Wb5fjAz).
* That’s a lot of people that didn’t get sick because of a mask. Masks allow us to return to work and for businesses to open safely.
* Governor takes back over:
* Today’s report shows escalating cases and our actions in the near future will determine if we are able to continue to have one of the best responses in the country or if we go the route of AZ that is reporting 1000’s of cases daily and are having to order in those massive freezer trucks to use a morgues. Hopefully today is a wakeup call. What we face is very, very real. More cases results in more deaths.
* Positive cases today: 576
* Probable cases:
* Total confirmed cases: 20,223
* New cases by county (From update, only counties with &gt; 10): 74x Jefferson, 66x Warren, 29x Fayette, 22x Boone, 19x Kenton, 18x Graves, 17x Madison, 12x Christian, 12x Hardin, 12x Hopkins, 11x Knox, 11x Montgomery, 10x Carter

* New deaths by county: 72 F Shelby, 77 M Floyd, 89 F Casey, 44 F Carter, 82 M Ohio, 65 M Fayette
* All losses are a loss for Kentucky. Let’s light those houses up green and let’s ring those bells at 10am. This is a reminder that we are thinking of the Kentuckians we’ve lost, their families, and their communities. It’s the color of compassion and renewal as their souls move from their bodies to a better place.

* KYSAFER hotline has been reactivated (1-833-KYSAFER). You can use this number to report rules and regulations not being followed. 
* Like we showed yesterday, the surgeon general said if we wore masks and said 6ft apart we could be beating this virus.
* [Today we are announcing more CARES ACT money going out to local governments](https://imgur.com/FhwmdD8)
* First, thank you to our local leaders for the help you have provided and stepping up to protect your people.
* We have set up $300M in CARES ACT funding for our local governments to apply for. 
* Today we are announcing $16.5M for 18 local governments in Central Kentucky including: Adair, Anderson, Bullitt, Franklin, Harrison, Jessamine, Nelson, Nicholas, Scott, Audubon Park, Cynthiana, Georgetown, Lexington-Fayette, Meadowvale, Sadieville, Somerset, and Stanford  
* Since we released the application we have had over 140 local governments apply. We have approved 38 so far and are working on more.

**QUESTIONS**

* Question about today’s hearings of the legislature -- Yesterday it appeared people were going to wear masks and Yesterday evening a state senator, we will respect his privacy, tested positive for COVID-19 who had been in the hearings. [But today we had almost every member of one political party's representatives and senators not wearing masks and not staying 6ft apart](https://imgur.com/XUFrAK8). Even after potentially being exposed, having a mask mandate in place, and after recording numbers of cases out there. This isn’t right. And remember this is the group that wants me to discuss the mask requirement with them.. It’s time for leadership and I hope and expect to see everyone in the annex wearing one starting tomorrow otherwise their employees are being put at risk. It also spreads contacts between reps/senators from all around that state. I didn’t take this picture, they posted it themselves. We are in a life and death battle, you can’t be doing that.
* Is there a scale-back of testing capacity at various sites around Kentucky with there being some longer lines and fewer lines? -- A couple of weeks ago we moved to summer hours for our Kroger sites because we weren’t seeing them being fully booked. Staring around the 4/5th of July we saw a huge uptick in demand for testing so we have increased hours at all Kroger sites. Other sites are still deciding what they will do, there was a risk the federal government would stop funding them but they appear to be changing their mind on that. Please go to [https://kycovid19.ky.gov](https://kycovid19.ky.gov/) to [find a testing location near you](https://imgur.com/AxdNyS7). We need people to get these tests.
   * &lt;Inaudible followup&gt; -- We are looking at ways to increase our capacity, we have contracted for another few months with Gravity Labs and we are working to make sure we get the results in a timely/faster manner. I believe we are in a better place now but we are looking to increase capacity.
* Question on visitation in nursing homes, has the guidance in that area changed with the recent spike? -- We are still moving ahead with the visitation but there are a number of safeguard in effect. If we find there is spread through that then we will have to look at it. The fact we are testing everyone in long-term care facilities gives us some comfort and now we are moving to testing staff.
* &lt;inaudible&gt; -- Let me try to get you some numbers on that. We get more anecdotal reports from how a cluster is created from local health departments. Right now the leader is people going on vacation and bringing it back. We have also seen it in HS sports practices. We have also seen some spread in houses of worship in some parts of Kentucky and in some other parts of Kentucky we have seen almost none. It all depends on the level of cleanliness that people are using. 
* Micahel Brown takes over to give a quick update on prisons as promised yesterday:
* Kentucky has 13 institutions that we run and as of today we have 624 inmates test positive system-wide, 83 staff, and 4 inmate deaths. The largest group was from Green River where we had 367 inmates and 51 staff which all but 1 have recovered. The KCIW (Pewee Valley) had its first positive case on May 26th from a staff member. Then 2 weeks later we started to see some symptoms in the inmates and on June 11th we had 11 positive inmate tests come back. A month later we have 207 inmates and 19 staff who have tested positive. At this point the entire institution has been tested and the inmates have all been re-tested just like at Green River. We have 4 inmates who are hospitalized from KCIW. At the Kentucky State Reformatory we had our first inmate positive on July 5th and as of today we have 49 positive inmates and 6 positive staff with 3 in the hospital. We have had no cases that the majority of our facilities and no staff deaths.
* Back to questions:
* &lt;inaudible&gt; -- The steps that were taken at Green River are the types of steps we need to be taking at our other prisons. Due to the setups it can be more challenging (separating out the different population. First you need to know who is positive and who is not and then you need to remove those who are not positive to contain it. Then you need to remove those who are medically fragile to protect them. We need to step up cleanliness and mask wearing at all times both for inmates and staff. I believe using our modal we can stabilize the situation.
* &lt;inaudible&gt; -- The first person to test positive at KCIW was staff but we will get back to you on the first case at KSR.
* Some listeners have contacted us to say their local health departments are refusing to take complaints of businesses not following the mask orders -- You can report those using 833-KY-SAFER (833-597-2337)
* Question about when evictions can take place again in Kentucky -- I believe there is a lawsuit in Northern Kentucky where we are going to ask for mediation. There are some important points it brings up but we want to make sure someone who can’t pay their rent because of COVID isn’t forced into certain agreements. For those that can pay their rent, you need to be paying your rent. 
* Question on testing -- Kroger is free to the public. The others are supposed to be but it doesn’t always work out that way because we have insurance, medicaid, many different types of payers out there. We have worked to eliminate other barriers to provide tests at little to no cost. Medicaid and private insurance should pay for it, we don’t want copays going to the individual and you should not need a doctor’s referral to get one. We have a complicated healthcare system. Trying to eliminate the ways you can be charged for a test is difficult but that is our goal. We need our private insurers to be doing reimbursements because that leads to a more robust private supply chain of testing.
* Questions about calls WPFL has received regarding employers that won’t pay employees when they have tested positive and/or are requiring certain procedures if you want to go and get tested. What are we doing to make sure the right incentives are in-place? -- It is incredibly short-sighted for a business to not offer paid leave to someone who has this virus because otherwise someone desperate isn’t going to tell you, they will go to work and infect your workforce so instead of paying 1 person for 14 days you could lose your entire workforce. That is just not smart business. It also means that business is not safe to the public so I hope everyone by now is doing paid leave in those situations. We have pushed for that. I heard that some employers are requiring permission before getting tested. Your employer cannot dictate your healthcare decisions, if you want to get tested and your employer is trying to stop you then call us here at state government and we will talk to them
* &lt;inaudible&gt; -- Today the committee that we showed earlier that wasn’t wearing masks took a vote to ask the AG and US Attorney to explore/investigate the contract to remove the Jefferson Davis statue. That’s silly. I didn’t know the company's name or who they were until I showed up the day they were removing it. All of the testimony here shows that what was done here follows each and every procedure. The individuals that voted for this didn’t bat an eyelid at either the Brady deal or what the last governor paid his chief of technology buddy. It’s just partisan politics at its worst. Also there are so many conflicts of interest in it, I believe the chairman of that committee, his son was the #2 lawyer for Bevin and is now the #2 lawyer for the AG. If that is accurate that would be like Steve Beshear &lt;Andy’s dad and a past Governor, if that wasn’t clear&gt; asking me to investigate Matt Bevin after Matt Bevin said something about him. And separately there, the ethics opinion in there about the AG’s office and investigations of the Governor’s office. Come on folks, at a time when we have such a challenge in front of us -- I mean this is just ridiculous and there is nothing there. I’m happy to talk to the US Attorney when I don’t even know the name of the company that is doing something or has a contract.
* &lt;inaudible&gt; -- We are going to get you a full report on UI claims remaining as well as the number processed under the contract in each of our locations this week. I hope to have that on Thursday. We have an issue in the data that we need to correct. There are certain claims that based on changes from the federal government were denied under the old law that are now allowed months later. What that does is it makes it look like a claim from March hasn’t been processed when the Fed government made us reject it and now we can consider it. We will break those numbers out to show you. We are typically getting \~1,000 people a day at these locations and we often get those cases resolved or they get a full explanation of why it hasn’t been resolved. We will get you that report and I’ll tell you I’m frustrated at how hard it is to get accurate data on it.
* Question on with cases in prisons have we thought about another round of releases -- We don’t have anything that we are considering right now but we are watching as these cases spread. We may go back to see if anyone has since qualified under those same old orders (non-violent, non-sexual offense with under a certain amount of sentence left).

**END QUESTIONS**

* Today as we close this press conference I’d like to take a moment to honor some of those that we have lost to this terrible virus. These are Kentuckians we shared before whose families have given us permission to share their loved one’s stories. They include Dana Davis, a beloved nurse who was only 51 years old and Maryland Thompson, another frontline healthcare worker from Bowling Green. It includes Jerry Maze a hard-working grandfather who was dearly missed by his grandchildren and my friend Lilian Press &lt;Governor chokes up a bit&gt; who impacted the lives of so many Kentuckians including my own and whose Governor’s Scholars program has been able to move along even in a very different phase. I know she would be proud of that. These are not just numbers, they are mothers, fathers, grandparents, and friends. They’re only a few of the individuals that COVID-19 has taken from us. In this moment, let’s lift all of those we’ve lost, all of our loved ones, up in prayer and let’s recommit to doing what it takes knowing that we could face more loss as we move into the future. These are special people and I hope the importance of preventing this loss is the most important thing to us. We have talked a whole lot the last couple of weeks about the number of court cases, or the number of hearings, or the number of other things. It’s the number of lives that counts. That’s it. I mean it’s about protecting those around us. I think we can do it while still keeping our economy open. I think we can do it in a way that hopefully lets our kids get back to some semblance of school. We need you to wear a mask, we need you to stay 6ft apart. Do it for David Turner Jr. who shows us how critical every single day is and do it for all these individuals whose families miss them. We will be back Thursday at 4pm and we will probably have a video out about tomorrow’s results. Stay safe, thanks.

Even so, this surge in positive cases is a shocking wake-up call. Kentucky has flattened the curve before and it must act immediately and decisively to flatten it again.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- As children and families stay at home in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, routine child checkups and vaccinations have fallen by the wayside.

According to a news release by WellCare of Kentucky, CDC data suggests that the coronavirus pandemic has caused individuals to question the safety of health clinics.

WellCare provides government-sponsored managed care services using Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans.

""As a result, the drop in immunization rates across Kentucky, and the country, are alarming,"" the news release states. ""Now, months later, as protocols such as waiting in cars have been put in place to minimize contact, and the advice has been updated when it comes to childhood vaccines, it is imperative to stay up to date on children's immunizations.""",20,1595266434,kentucky,2020-07-20 13:33:54

* Dr. Stack: &lt;more below&gt; So I’m here to tell you that Sunday was a rude wakeup call. It was a warning, if we don’t intervene we’re going to see the fate here in KY that they’re seeing in some of these other states, and our fate is collectively in Team KY’s hands, is in each one of your hands, whether we can adopt a simple measure like wearing a mask, which more and more people more and more experts say, this one measure, alone, if we do it consistently, and every time we come within 6ft of each other, could help control this pandemic well enough to bridge us until we get to a vaccine/cure. I hope some of this helps motivate, inspire, we’re not really at the phase I want to instill fear, but if we don’t take some strong action, people will see just how bad it can get in KY, and just believe me on this, we don’t want to go there. &lt;more below&gt;
* &lt;more below&gt; Gov Beshear: So I know that there are attempts to spread disinformation out there and they’re not helpful. They’re not helpful since they downplay the seriousness of what we’re dealing with, and sometimes when we need to buckle down and do the best we’ve ever done, maybe it even gives an excuse. And one we keep hearing over and over is there are just more tests. Can we show the positivity chart? [This is a chart about the percentage of tests that come back positive](https://imgur.com/zlPTEKl). It compares 100 tests May 17 with 100 tests July 19, and how many of those - taking out the total number of tests- but just how many of those come back with positive results. It shows you in a way that normalizes, and prevents the amount of overall tests from impacting the comparison of where we are, and I just want you to look at that graph. I want you to see the increase, especially the last several weeks, and it shows you the virus is spreading more aggressively. &lt;more below&gt;
* &lt;more below&gt; [So today we’re putting out a travel advisory, where we are asking anyone that goes to another state with over a 15% positivity rate to quarantine for 14 days when they come back](https://imgur.com/dR1ktvK). This is a request, for each of the individuals, but 15% is really dangerous. It’s not like we put the line where this group suggests we stop reopening - that’s at 5%. &lt;more below&gt;
* &lt;more below&gt; So for social gatherings, we had increased the amount of people you could have up to 50, we’re reducing that back down to 10. That doesn’t affect any businesses, any venues, any outdoor weddings - those are all regulated by other things out there and they have licenses that give them the motivation to clean and do the right thing.
* Could the spike we’re seeing over the last week be from July 4th activities given the lag time from when you get infected to when it starts to show? -- the answer is yes. I think it’s a number of things together, I think we had a period of time that ended July 5th that we were lax, we were tired.

**Summarized (Full) Notes**

* &lt;Feed missing at start&gt;
* Dr. Stack:
* … but so far I’ve not found anything to suggest it’s not correct. I think it’s very, very difficult for people to understand what exponential growth is, people aren’t used to that. We understand getting in a car and pressing on the accelerator and going 10, 20, 30, 40 miles and hour. People aren’t used to going from 10, 100, 1000. So, we had 7 of our highest 8 days period before Sunday. Then we had Sunday which was the biggest number by far. So that means we’re going to be in that acceleration range. While 100 t0 300 might not seem like a big jump, the problem is once you hit the inflection point, you start a vertical climb, where it’s like going up mt. Everest. It’s similar to what we’ve seen in TX, AZ, NY, FL. We have had people mad on both sides of the spectrum. Some think we did too much and others think we did too little. Maybe since people are upset on either extreme, maybe we’re doing it right. But we know we can control this, in NYC they took aggressive steps, and got down to zero deaths, and then TX, AZ, FL and other states are showing it can climb right back up again. We have one state that has done it twice, LA took aggressive measures and then relaxed and its spiking again. I’ve told you many times that there’s a lot we don’t know. The scientists, Public Health officials, they all talk about is having the consistent sense of humility, about the many things we don’t know and the things we don't know we don’t know, and the difficulty in trying to manage through the fog of uncertainty as we’re trying to recommend things to you. So I’m here to tell you that Sunday was a rude wakeup call. It was a warning, if we don’t intervene we’re going to see the fate here in KY that they’re seeing in some of these other states, and our fate is collectively in Team KY’s hands, is in each one of your hands, whether we can adopt a simple measure like wearing a mask, which more and more people more and more experts say, this one measure, alone, if we do it consistently, and every time we come within 6ft of each other, could help control this pandemic well enough to bridge us until we get to a vaccine/cure. I hope some of this helps motivate, inspire, we’re not really at the phase I want to instill fear, but if we don’t take some strong action, people will see just how bad it can get in KY, and just believe me on this, we don’t want to go there.
* Gov Beshear takes over:
* So I know that there are attempts to spread disinformation out there and they’re not helpful. They’re not helpful since they downplay the seriousness of what we’re dealing with, and sometimes when we need to buckle down and do the best we’ve ever done, maybe it even gives an excuse. And one we keep hearing over and over is there are just more tests. Can we show the positivity chart? [This is a chart about the percentage of tests that come back positive](https://imgur.com/zlPTEKl). It compares 100 tests May 17 with 100 tests July 19, and how many of those - taking out the total number of tests- but just how many of those come back with positive results. It shows you in a way that normalizes, and prevents the amount of overall tests from impacting the comparison of where we are, and I just want you to look at that graph. I want you to see the increase, especially the last several weeks, and it shows you the virus is spreading more aggressively. Remember when you compare when it peaked early, we didn’t have a whole lot of tests. We were only testing the people who had symptoms, we were pretty sure they would have it! And now, we’re significantly increasing again. It means it’s spreading significantly out there and we must make sure that we take the steps to keep ourselves safe, our families safe, and each other safe. So no - any concept that there’s just more testing out there and the virus is still in the same place is absolutely and categorically false. We need people to know that, and a fact’s a fact, Twitter can’t change that. Make sure that you understand where we are right now so we can adopt what we need to do to get through. And remember, just yesterday, there were nearly 1,000 cases, that means we will lose an additional 30 people. Let’s make sure that we change that curve that's up there and every other one, to protect the people around us.
* Today is a Monday, most of our testing centers are closed on Sunday so we have few overall cases that come in. Today we’re announcing 258 new cases of COVID-19. It used to be if we announced that amount on a Monday, it’d almost be shocking - remember we’ve had a lot of Mondays where we had 90. I expect that number will grow some tomorrow while it’s still catching up, and unfortunately I expect that number to be up by Wednesday or Thursday. That’s just typical of how things work.
* Positive cases today: 258
* Probable cases:
* Total confirmed cases:
* New Cases by County: 93x Jefferson, 36x Fayette, 8x Kenton, 7x Shelby, 7x Warren, 6x Boyd, 5x Campbell, 5x Christian, 5x Daviess, 5x Graves, 5x Hardin, 5x Harlan, 4x Greenup, 3x Casey, 3x Green, 3x Muhlenberg, 3x Pulaski, 3x Taylor, 2x Boone, 2x Boyle, 2x Grant, 2x Knox, 2x Laurel, 2x Marion, 2x McCracken, 2x Nelson, 2x Oldham, 1x Adair, 1x Anderson, 1x Barren, 1x Bell, 1x Bourbon, 1x Breckinridge, 1x Bullitt, 1x Calloway, 1x Carter, 1x Clay, 1x Crittenden, 1x Cumberland, 1x Franklin, 1x Grayson, 1x Henderson, 1x Lawrence, 1x Lee, 1x Livingston, 1x Logan, 1x Mason, 1x McCreary, 1x Meade, 1x Ohio, 1x Perry, 1x Powell, 1x Russell, 1x Scott, 1x Wayne, 1x Whitley, 1x Woodford, 4x Unconfirmed
* Total tests conducted: 533,143 - one would have thought that wasn’t possible just 2 months ago, but I think people are waking up and suddenly, even though we have significant testing capacity, there's a big demand out there, and we’re working to meet it, we’re working to provide more testing to those who can administer it- so we’re working on getting more testing than we were seeing.
* Positivity Rate: 4.52% (7-day rolling average); what we’re seeing from some of our neighbors, while they had a higher positivity rate to start with, they are increasing by about 2% like we have over the last 2-4 weeks
* Total hospitalized: 2,882 
* Currently hospitalized: 542
* Currently hospitalized: 542
* Total in ICU: 1,035
* Currently in ICU: 114
* Total recovered: 6,876
* New cases of children under 5**:** 8, 2 just 3 months old both in Jefferson county, but all over Green, Boyd, Bourbon, This is impacting children and the youngest amongst us
* New deaths today: 1; Again, deaths trail new cases, and while I feel for this family and it’s a family we need to support, compared to yesterday and the day before, today has been merciful to our people and we want to keep it that way.
* Total Deaths: 671
* New deaths by county: 94 F Casey
* All losses are a loss for Kentucky. Let’s light those houses up green and let’s ring those bells at 10am. This is a reminder that we are thinking of the Kentuckians we’ve lost, their families, and their communities. It’s the color of compassion and renewal as their souls move from their bodies to a better place.
* Racial breakdown of all cases: 77.96% Caucasian, 12.48% Black or African-American, 3% Asian, 5.84% Multiracial
* Ethnicity breakdown of all cases: 84.47% non-Hispanic and 15.53% Hispanic
* Racial breakdown of all deaths: 81.3% Caucasian, 14.7% Black or African-American, 1.44% Asian, 2.56% Multiracial
* Ethnicity breakdown of all deaths: 95.81% non-Hispanic and 4.19% Hispanic
* [Long Term Care Facilities](https://imgur.com/wEnC5Ne): 1 less resident and 14 new staff positive from yesterday, and 5 more deaths, 1 new facility. 2238 residents, 1197 staff, 443 deaths, 233 facilities
* LTC numbers continue to grow, one of the reasons we’ve engaged in the most widespread testing. One challenge is that one individual may work at 2, 3, even 4 LTC facilities, which means spread is very possible and can happen quickly if we can’t monitor and routinely test that personnel.
* We’re going to announce some new steps that we need to take today, but I want to talk first about one part of a call. Today was the call that the WH does, that the VP handled. He was talking about their modeling for areas that have been hit really hard, AZ, TX, and those cities. And they talked about the steps that they believe are necessary if we are hit and hit hard. Some of these steps we are doing, some I think we all want to avoid by addressing this early because of what it can do to business. Now I want to say up front, these are the WH suggestions. This is not what we are doing today, but I think they show us the inevitable if we can’t get this under control. [Again, this was part of a document people were talking about, this was on the call today advising us](https://imgur.com/yhXoaCF). Facial coverings, we’re already doing this. It’s mandatory, necessary. Second thing they said in hard-hit areas was reducing restaurant capacity at 25%. Listen I remember when we did it at 33% and how so many of our restaurant businesses can’t operate at that.  I want to make sure we don’t hit that surge that we’ve seen in other places. So we don’t have to adopt the WH suggestions. So to our restaurants, please encourage the mask wearing, please encourage people when they’re not at your restaurant to be doing the right thing. Unfortunately, the science is showing if people don’t take care of themselves, this is one of the things that happen. And finally #3, they recommend closing bars. On that #3, I feel for a number of our owners because one facility doing the wrong thing can hurt it for everyone else. Sec. Friedlander was out, and I don’t know what area of Bardstown Rd in Louisville on Saturday night and was really really concerned with what he saw. When everybody isn’t doing it right and we hit a surge, if you’re one of these facilities not following the rules, you’re only hurting yourself. Please work with us during this pandemic to do what’s necessary.
* So with especially the last week, with having our first-third-fourth-fifth highest day totals that we’ve had in the span of a week, we know we have to do a couple things. First is to address what I Think is the #1 cluster-causer in the past month, and that is travel. It’s travel to Myrtle Beach, travel to FL, travel to SC, or some other beach. And I’ve been up here, admittedly begging and pleading for people not to go when we know how much has been brought back, and sadly, a person will go to the beach, where a lot of people are testing positive, then they’ll come back, go to work, then they’ll go to church and do a number of other things and it spreads throughout those areas too, and can shut down the work and really impact the church and is something we have to take stronger steps towards. [So today we’re putting out a travel advisory, where we are asking anyone that goes to another state with over a 15% positivity rate to quarantine for 14 days when they come back](https://imgur.com/dR1ktvK). This is a request, for each of the individuals, but 15% is really dangerous. It’s not like we put the line where this group suggests we stop reopening - that’s at 5%. What that means is these areas are where the virus is uncontrolled, and I’m not blaming any of these areas, actually. MS gov was on the call today, and you could hear the pain, he cares about his people, this has happened really fast, and I want the absolute best for everybody. But these are areas that right now we know aren’t safe, you look at Arizona almost 1 in 4 individuals is testing positive there. This is something where we need people to change their plans because it’s a life and death matter for this commonwealth. I get you need to get away, I’d love for you to travel in KY, it’d help in several ways, I’d love if you travel in KY that you do it in a safe way- whether it is finding a house somewhere, that you know you can clean when you come in. But these are absolutely hot spots that right now are just dangerous, and they’re seriously and significantly impacting our numbers. I believe that High School that we talked about just on Friday, that has 30+ people related to the football team and the gym, I think they contracted the first case and what ultimately shut down that program for a period to a vacation. Let’s make sure we are not bringing this back into our communities.
* \#2, (so #1 we’re seeing clusters created by travel), #2 we’re seeing clusters created by our backyard barbecues and our block parties. It’s because we let our guard down. We have a bunch of friends over- and we know them, and we’re pretty sure they’re doing everything right, we just take our masks down, about halfway through, we relax, we get close-  And we’re seeing some very difficult outcomes because of it. So for social gatherings, we had increased the amount of people you could have up to 50, we’re reducing that back down to 10. That doesn’t affect any businesses, any venues, any outdoor weddings - those are all regulated by other things out there and they have licenses that give them the motivation to clean and do the right thing. But we’re just seeing too much spread from 50 people getting together in someone’s backyard or in their neighborhood. Now I know 10 is different. But 10 is much more manageable. It can contain the spread and if everybody could help us out with that again, we don’t want to become AZ or FL. FL is 11-16k cases a day, and we had almost 1k just yesterday. This is us trying to stop this thing before it gets out of control, and so much depends on it. I know I say it, but I hope you feel it- it’s the lives and health of Kentuckians. It oughta be enough; it’s people being able to go to work and we’re having a lot of jobs able to come back online, and none of us want to stop that. It’s also our ability when we can to open schools. If we can’t do the right thing and wear masks in places we need to, if we can’t agree to have 10 people over instead of 50, the job that our school systems face, compared to that, is so difficult. And, we’ve got to make sure we’re not asking schools to open at a time when our cases are increasing significantly, we need to make sure they’re under control. So I need to see us start turning this tide around, or we’ll need to look at recommendations for schools, cause we can’t have our children or our teachers going into really difficult situations. Let me say to our superintendents, you have such a difficult task, trust me I know, I know that it’s further complicated by an increase in cases.  Please help us  throughout the community to let people know that everything we do outside of schools can impact the ability to be in schools. Let’s sacrifice and do what we need to try to get our kids back in schools. Given those 2 steps we’re taking, I’m going to ask Dr. Stack to talk about the importance of them then we will give a quick UI update and take questions.
* Dr. Stack takes over
* Thanks again Gov, so on these 2 steps for the travel and positivity rate that’s up there, I try to use publicly available references when I talk at these press references because I want the public to be able to go see it for themselves and you don't have to rely on me to hand it to you. So we use the John Hokkins website for this ([https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/)), and there’s a testing link at the top. So you can go and look and see that same data, and they show on there, states that meet the recommendations that they use for under 5%, most people use for a disease under better control- or when it’s over 5%, and we’ve cut the threshold at 15%. So we weren’t going low here, we were just trying to say these are like going to a nuclear waste zone for how intense the disease is spreading, it’s not a good idea to go there. [Again, as I said earlier, some say we do too much, some say we do too little, this is a recommendation, this is an advisory. I’m telling you what you need to do to stay safe and not get infected, it’s your choice at some level what to do](https://imgur.com/dR1ktvK). And when we have to, we make requirements. But I want to continue to inspire people to do the right thing. I had the opportunity to have an extended discussion with some folks about the various implications of this disease and there is a lot of emphasis on the economic difficulties and those are real. Economic, loss of socialization, the isolation this has caused for a lot of folks, problems with deferred medical care, increased overdose deaths. We are aware of these things, these are things, I’m the public health commissioner, that pain us because we work very hard to try to improve these things, and the pandemic has worsened all of them. The way we avoid those things, is to take the steps that control our destiny, by wearing masks, increasing social distancing. So that leads to reducing group sizes to 10 or less. So for the organized activities, we’ve not further curtailed restaurants and venues and events and organized activities. The business owners share a responsibility and obligation to try to help follow these guidelines- and ensure a safe place for their customers to enjoy their business. So we’re relying on them to play a large role to foster the kind of environment we need in those settings. When we get to our informal gatherings, which are typically with our friends and family, that’s where we let our guard down. Where you might give a spontaneous hug, a pat on the back. You nudge someone or lean into someone or get close while you’re talking. They’re your friends and your families, but they are often from other households, maybe from other states/communities and the larger the number of people we bring together, the more we increase the probability that one person with infection spreads it to multiple people. Months ago I used a couple of different metaphors for how this spreads but this is the buckshot metaphor. One person infects a bunch and then they scatter and they take that disease all throughout the state and to other states. So please, pay attention to these things - which states we’ve recommended you not travel to, and if you do that regardless, self-quarantine when you come home for 14 days. You can look online at those states with over 15%. ([https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/)). Restrict your gatherings to 10 or less, these guidelines are not new to you, they were on our website before they’re things we did before and now because we are seeing this dramatic increase in cases we are going to step backwards gently in our phases to try to get this under control.
* Gov Beshear takes over
* And we know how many Kentuckians travel to so many of these places, and I hope we can see just what the numbers show, if you took this as an example because these are people being tested there, there’s a good probability that 18 out of every 100 people that travel to FL from KY would have the Coronavirus. That’s just something that we can’t expose other people to. I know we need breaks, I hope you can find a break, I am asking you to do it safely, and if you go to a place that’s not safe, make sure you do what it takes afterwards to not infect your community. We just can’t ignore this. I feel like sometimes that’s what happens. We’re just so tired and we love going to the beach, listen there’s a beach in FL that’s one of my favorite places on earth, and we haven't gone, because I can't justify the risk to my kids, my wife, the community around me, the people who rely on me.
* Quick bit on UI - we ought to see a lot of claims processed this week and early this week. We have now 23,000 claims that EY has gone through and are awaiting    our individuals to give final approval to, in our UI office. That’s why we’re only in Frankfort this week, we need them to get through those 23k claims- that will significantly diminish what we have right now, obviously EY and others are still working on processing claims as we go. So while I wish we had those 2 in-person offices out there this week, it’s for a very good reason that we’ll have a real and significant impact on our remaining claims. 

**QUESTIONS**

We have a number of folks who are here, will try to do at least 20 minutes, and have a couple written ones too.

* Question about a center for investigative reporting report on our former head of unemployment insurance. -- Every single campaign contribution is public so the entire public and all of the press has access to see exactly who gave and who didn’t, but no contribution to a campaign ever resulted in any employment anywhere in state government. I think you can see who did the most, aren’t there. My understanding is he was a practicing lawyer for how many years, 10? 15? That’s pretty good training for a few places around state government. Now it didn’t work out, and it got very very messy in the end. I think it got very emotional in the end. Aside from that I don’t have firsthand knowledge of any of the rest of it. &lt;inaudible follow&gt; -- I mean that hire was made in the  cabinet, and it’s hard Monday-morning-quarterbacking something, certainly with it being messy in the end, I think everyone wishes either the situation hadn’t happened or turned out how it is. There’s lots of hiring in the private and the public sector that don’t go well, or they could’ve been good hiring, but things happen- misunderstandings at different times, people might have a difficulty in their personal life- And any different area, it’s just - employment can be a tough, a difficult area, that’s why there are thousands upon thousands of lawyers who do unemployment work.
* Where do we stand right now on field hospitals? Hopefully we won’t need them? -- Thank you for saying hopefully we don't need them. With our current trajectory, we might - and that’s why the field hospital that we created at the fairgrounds is still there, we could have that up and ready in less than a week. The only thing we had to take down were the partitions, which we would want to put back up, cause those were costing us a weekly and they’re easy to put back up, and we are ready with that, and we can also turn the key on different state parks if we need them. Those are for lower acuity, that can free up hospital beds, too. Each of our hospitals made surge plans that we can put into effect that increases the number of beds they have and the number of ICU beds they have. Right now we’re still in a pretty good position with our overall number of hospital beds and overall number of ICU beds, but that can change pretty quickly when you have 979 cases.
* It’s been 10 days since the mask mandate was enacted, can you tell us when we can see because of that- Tuesday? Wednesday? -- Let me ask Dr. Stack to answer that, since he was giving me a tutorial. Question was on how long it will take to see the impact of the mask mandate which I do think will have an impact. He can give you the timing. The question will be will we see a reduction, will we see the escalation stop, will it be less of an escalation that it would otherwise be. We’ll have to look at all of that. DR STACK TAKES OVER So, the question is about the mask mandate and when will we see a mask mandate in our cases. With all of this, if only it was that simple to be objective and scientific and say this is the absolute truth and we don’t know for sure. Here’s what happens with the disease. So we know that the average person who gets infected - average person, so 50% - gets sick and shows symptoms within 5 days. We know that 97% of people who are going to show signs and symptoms will show them by day 11. That’s why we have the 14 day quarantine, since that’s when you get up to almost everyone who is likely to show signs of infection will do it within 2 weeks. So what we see with the coronavirus is, in rough terms, our actions today are reflected in developments 3-4 weeks later, because the early signal when you start seeing an increase in cases is small, and it amplifies over time, just like a snowball rolling down a hill, turning larger. So the mask mandate, if we had 80-90% compliance with this, you could expect to see 2-3 weeks after we implemented it that we'd start to see a decrease again. So I’d like to see another plateau here about 2 weeks after we did it, then if we start seeing the numbers going down, then I think we can say it’s had the impact we wanted. Governor takes over. And let me just say: We know it will have an impact, we know - no matter what percentage of people are additionally wearing them, and I think it’s a large percentage, but any percentage will prevent some amount of spread. What we’re going to find out is how much. The WH says their modeling shows it would have significant impact. And Lord I hope and I pray that that is true.
* People are telling us appointments are booked up and they’ll have to wait at least a week to get tested and some of those who have gotten tested are reporting a delay in results. -- We are working now on expanding our testing. We purchased more capacity from one of our homegrown labs so that we would not have the delay in getting results. What we can’t control are the national labs, and yes they are getting very backed up due to the large number of cases- in places like FL, TX, sunbelt region. We’re working on expanding capacity even greater than it has been, and the fact there is that demand is a good thing. But we do have to put the structures in place, it’s not the tests themselves, It’s getting the administration, the booking, the recording of the info, so that you can get the call back. We’re working with our major cities, where that demand is to provide more testing.
* Could the spike we’re seeing over the last week be from July 4th activities given the lag time from when you get infected to when it starts to show?-- Question is could our significant increase be as a result of 4th of July activities - the answer is yes. I think it’s a number of things together, I think we had a period of time that ended July 5th that we were lax, we were tired. I think everyone out there can admit that, I get it, I feel it. June hit and you thought “It’s the middle of the summer!” and we’d hoped that heat would do something to this. If heat does anything to it, it increases it, or pushes people together because of it. But the 4th of July is an example, and it’s a great holiday, but it’s a time where we get together in large groups and that’s something we have to cut down on. But I think people out there get it. I can tell you that the day we saw capacity go from too few people showing up to get tested, to more than we had the capacity for, was July 5th. After the 4th people realized that we’ve got states that are surging and we’ve got to get a little bit more serious, and that’s not a criticism of the people of KY. We have great people who are doing a great job, we just have to realize the stakes got a lot harder and this war is going to be a lot longer than we hoped.
* The WH call discussed closing bars, and reducing restaurant capacity. What steps are you taking from those specific recommendations? -- So what the WH was talking about is when you see really large surges like AZ and other places. [These are the steps they would take. We’re not there yet](https://imgur.com/yhXoaCF). We know the impact this would have on our restaurants and our bars at the moment, that they’re small businesses, they employ a lot of people. We want to avoid #2, and #3. We’re already doing number 1, facial coverings, at a level right now that those states didn’t do it at. But we’re also taking some other steps to try to reduce clusters that we see in KY. We don’t see the number of bar clusters, but that might be because we haven’t discovered them. Because we’re not seeing the type of behaviour we really need. We’re not seeing nearly the number related to bars that we are to travel, so a lot of what we’re doing right now is addressing where we absolutely know we are seeing cases and I think it’s fair to say, it’s the low hanging fruit. It’s areas where we know we can cut down cases, because we know if we go to a place where 1 in 5 people test positive, we’re likely to get the virus, or at least more likely than if we’re here. Just trying to take those steps first before we have to take these &lt;gestures at slide&gt;. I want people to know what is being recommended out there if we hit an AZ type level and I hope we don’t.
* Travel and large informal gatherings are 2 of the cluster-causers but those aren’t advisory recommendations that have been made into orders \[Beshear interrupts: one is\] why an advisory recommendation instead of an order? -- So the question is on why one is an advisory (the travel) and one is a mandate (&lt;10 people gatherings). That’s really just moving back to what we were operating in before, the travel advisory is because a federal court in KY struck down the last time we had a mandate about not traveling to areas that had significant cases. It said we had to have rules more like Ohio’s, which is an advisory. So, we’re doing the best we can with the tools that we have.

* New deaths by county: 95 M Shelby, 63 M Calloway, 91 F Casey
* We now have 24,060 cases of COVID-19 since this pandemic started. Obviously if you look at the last 10 days, 2 weeks, or even 3 weeks, a very large portion of that has happened very recently. It means now is the most important time during the course of this pandemic, after stopping it from doubling every 3 days, early on to make sure that we can get the upper hand, that we can control this, that we can keep our economy open, that we can save lives, that we can get our kids back in school.
* [Here is a map of KY](https://imgur.com/RZXcQo7).This is before today’s results- With today’s results, we will have at least one other county turn the deepest color here, which is, meaning 100-5,300 cases since this started. There is no safe region in KY anymore, and some of these areas, that are still the lightest color, remember so was Harlan, so was Bell- and Harlan will turn that darker color after this report, and it almost happened overnight.  There is only one way to address this virus- and that is with statewide policies- because when you can have 100 cases over the course of a week- Surely to God we want to prevent that and not to say there’s not a problem here until it’s out of control. 
* Now know that there hasn't been enough time for when an infection occurs for us to see the results of the requirement to wear facial coverings. But that requirement will only work to stop the increase in cases if people do it. They can pretty much scientifically prove now that IF we can have 95% of people wearing them when they’re out, when they wear them when they’re within 6ft of other people,  it will work. It will absolutely work and we can do almost everything that we want to do. From saving lives to keeping the economy open- If we could do that and get this thing under control it will make what we can do in schools so much easier. But we need your buy-in to do it. Remember, everyone else is counting on us.
* Dr. Stack: I just want to share information on 2 concepts:  One is, we would like to be as precise as we can in our interventions. But one of the ways that precision is not realistic is if we want to do things county-by-county, it just doesn’t work. So I’m going to put this in context for you. So this virus that we said didn’t exist until late last year, was an unknown entity in Wuhan China which is about 7,500 miles away from Lexington, KY where I live. That virus managed to make it’s way over to NYC in two months from China. Within a month and a half, NYC was under water with COVID infections overwhelming their hospitals. So, from Pikeville to Paducah is 375 miles on Apple maps. IF we don’t think that the virus can’t get from Pikeville to Paducah in less than 2 months when it got from China to NYC which is about 7,000 miles apart in two months then I think we delude ourselves and we’re not being realistic. &lt;more below&gt;The other thing I wanted to share is people focus on, and at times assert, that there is  an attempt to fear monger related to this and I dispute that. I think we’ve been very balanced and very clear. It appears the vast majority of people, at least acutely, do just fine with this. But the problem is 15-20% of people are at high risk and if you’re in a higher risk category you don’t do just fine with it. If you are over 60, that accounts for 9/10 of our deaths by our current statistics. There are certain populations, and there are a large percent of the people of KY who are at high risk and can have a very terrible outcome. But I don’t want to just focus on mortality.&lt;More Below&gt;With SARS-COV-2, which is the name of the virus that causes COVID-19, we know that it causes stroke in some people, it causes severe inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)- it causes respiratory failure in many. In a number of individuals it is almost as if you’ve poured Drano in their lungs because they have permanent damage afterwards and multiple months of prolonged problems with low oxygen levels and difficulty recovering. It can cause blood clots in your lungs called pulmonary embolism. In kids we now know they don’t show any signs sometimes and then a couple of months later they develop a multi-system inflammatory syndrome that puts them up in the ICU and is very serious and threatening. And there are other issues like long-term cognitive impact or neurocognitive damage that we don’t fully understand, and of course it can cause a loss of sense of smell, which is a neurological problem, clearly involving the nervous system,  and this disease has only been around for 6 months. So those other illnesses we’ve known for decades and have catalogued what happens with people. This one has been around for 6 months, we don’t know what happens, we don’t know what the long term consequences are. I think people need to know that. Cause when we take the steps we are taking to protect Kentuckians, from this illness, it's because there's much we don’t know. What we do know, is terrifying for those that are most vulnerable to it. But we really don’t know the true extent of our vulnerability and who will ultimately be impacted or who will have long-term consequences. I don’t consider it fear mongering, I consider it informing. I think people need to be informed and there are a lot of reasons why people who devote their lives to public medicine and public health are very concerned about this infection and why we recommended the things we have in trying to protect you from it.
* Lt Governor: I wanna give a little bit of a repeat of some of the things we have done so far as well as make a few new announcements. First of all we have worked in conjunction with KDE, the Education Continuation Taskforce, and others to [release the Healthy at School guidance](https://imgur.com/loIxU5Z). &lt;more below&gt;. [On Thursday, the KDE and the Education and Workforce Development cabinet is hosting a virtual Town Hall on reopening schools](https://imgur.com/0cjC2co) &lt;more below&gt;. [Finally, I want to make sure folks know that last week I wrote a letter to Secretary DeVoss, the KY Congressional Delegation, and my State Education Secretary Colleagues  across the country with an appeal for an additional round of flexible CARES funding for our state budget](https://imgur.com/IrMPCHo) &lt;more below&gt;
* Speaker Osborn and Pro Tempore did a FB Live with Richard Nelson of the Commonwealth Policy Center- “The one size fits all approach needs to go, the approach needs to be more surgical with less restrictions in place with low infection rates.” -- I think the experience in Harlan and Bell county, both of which Bell county judges support our facial covering, shows you can go from very few cases to being overwhelmed almost immediately. When you think about when you put a restriction in place, it will take 2 weeks, to start stemming the tide. Look what can happen in two weeks? Warren county went from regular to one of the tops in the country at one point. We can’t wait for the virus to overwhelm us before we act. If you are in an area with a low positivity rate then that’s great, let’s keep it there.
* E&amp;Y contract expires at the end of the month. Will it be renewed? How many more Claims do we have? -- We had 29k claims they processed, just waiting on final approval. That's going to significantly reduce outstanding claims. We have a lot of initial claims that we need to get through- if we hit the 50k mark we would like, we’d be close, but we have a lot of second time claims and a lot of claims still coming in. We’d look at renewing that contract. It depends on where we’re at. We’re at 5k initial March claims. What we weren’t pulling out before, we’d have people that would file a month later, but if they filed for 1 day the month before then it would show up as a March claim. That’s something we should have addressed in our numbers.

**Summarized (Full) Notes**

* Alright, it is Tuesday at 4 pm in our continued war against COVID-19. We know, based on what we have been seeing over this past week where we had 5 of the highest days on record, that it’s serious, and that it’s escalating. Again the positive news is that we know how to beat it and if we are committed to it, we can and will do what it takes. But we are in such a critical period. First, across the US cases continue to escalate, and while we’ll talk about travel advisories and others, remember this is one country and this virus doesn’t respect borders. We put policies in place to do as much as we can, but as this virus is surging across the US it’s ultimately going to surge in a number of different places. Here in KY, our surge continues as well, today we are reporting our second-highest ever total with 674 new cases of COVID-19. That’s not good news. You know, when you look at good news, you can look at our mortality rate- which we talked about the other day, one of the lowest in the country, our mortality rates is about 3% but that would mean, if it continues to be about that, today's number might indicate in the loss of 20...20 Kentuckians. So I hope when we see 674 new cases, that we know we have to do better, we are committed to do better. And I see a lot of that out there. We have had reports from a number of counties, Harlan County judge-executive, just the other day called and provided a statement that we put on social media about how he is seeing the vast majority of individuals, in his county, go from nor wearing a mask to wearing on everyday in the area’s we need to see them. And we are seeing that across KY. So as we go through now to this time next week, we really hope to see these cases to stop escalating- to plateau, and hopefully over time to start going down. That’s what we got to do to make sure we aren’t one of those states where their cases are still exploding and we still have time to act but we have to know that we are on that trajectory, we are on that path without everybody buying in and doing the right thing. 
* We now have 24,060 cases of COVID-19 since this pandemic started. Obviously if you look at the last 10 days, 2 weeks, or even 3 weeks, a very large portion of that has happened very recently. It means now is the most important time during the course of this pandemic, after stopping it from doubling every 3 days, early on to make sure that we can get the upper hand, that we can control this, that we can keep our economy open, that we can save lives, that we can get our kids back in school.
* Today 674 new cases include 22 kids under 5- Tomorrow we’ll be able to show you data that shows the daily positives- it is increasing, and is increasing significantly. Early on we weren’t testing a lot of young kinds but what we are seeing is- When we say young kids testing positive we actually sometimes mean really young individuals so we have to make sure that whether it’s in our childcare centers or our homes that we are doing everything we can to protect our loved ones. And remember, we can’t send kids with positive cases to school or daycare. So if we allow our numbers to increase amongst our young people it makes it really challenging, it puts our teachers at risk and Lt. Gov Coleman is gonna provide an update as it concerns our school reopenings here in just a little bit.
* [Here is a map of KY](https://imgur.com/RZXcQo7).This is before today’s results- With today’s results, we will have at least one other county turn the deepest color here, which is, meaning 100-5,300 cases since this started. There is no safe region in KY anymore, and some of these areas, that are still the lightest color, remember so was Harlan, so was Bell- and Harlan will turn that darker color after this report, and it almost happened overnight.  There is only one way to address this virus- and that is with statewide policies- because when you can have 100 cases over the course of a week- Surely to God we want to prevent that and not to say there’s not a problem here until it’s out of control. That would be taking approaches like we are seeing in certain other states where the numbers have to be in the 1,000’s before we act, that would be what would be happening on a smaller scale in our counties. Listen, do we want to pretend like people don’t drive from one of these counties to another every day to work, to shop, or to do other things? This is important that we make sure we are all doing our part- throughout KY and I think every public health expert would agree that this is the time for statewide action, all of us coming together, make sure we get this done. 
* Positive cases today: 674
* Probable cases: 1,144
* Total confirmed cases: 24,060 - As you all know, we read these numbers everyday. You can know the overall tests we have done and by simply subtracting the previous day you can know the number of tests that have come in today.
* Children Under 5: 22
* New Cases by County: 180x Jefferson, 35x Fayette, 24x Warren, 23x Barren, 22x Harlan, 22x Madison, 19x Hardin, 17x Kenton, 14x McCracken, 13x Bullitt, 13x Campbell, 13x Henderson, 12x Boone, 12x Casey, 12x Daviess, 11x Oldham, 10x Laurel, 9x Shelby, 7x Graves, 7x Jessamine, 6x Bell, 6x Muhlenberg, 6x Perry, 6x Pulaski, 6x Scott, 6x Simpson, 5x Adair, 5x Allen, 5x Anderson, 5x Green, 5x Logan, 5x Wayne, 4x Boyd, 4x Clay, 4x Cumberland, 4x Floyd, 4x Franklin, 4x Fulton, 4x Harrison, 4x Hopkins, 4x Jackson, 4x Lawrence, 4x Nelson, 4x Pike, 4x Rockcastle, 4x Whitley, 3x Carter, 3x Grayson, 3x Marion, 3x Martin, 3x Powell, 3x Union, 3x Washington, 3x Webster, 2x Boyle, 2x Breathitt, 2x Calloway, 2x Clinton, 2x Edmonson, 2x Greenup, 2x Hart, 2x Hickman, 2x Knott, 2x Lincoln, 2x Marshall, 2x Ohio, 2x Russell, 2x Todd, 2x Woodford, 1x Butler, 1x Carlisle, 1x Christian, 1x Clark, 1x Crittenden, 1x Gallatin, 1x Garrard, 1x Hancock, 1x Henry, 1x Johnson, 1x Larue, 1x Livingston, 1x Meade, 1x Mercer, 1x Metcalfe, 1x Monroe, 1x Morgan, 1x Owen, 1x Rowan, 1x Spencer, 1x Taylor, 1x Trigg, 1x Wolfe
* We have a number of counties in double digits. That’s why they’ll go to the darker color. We have a lot of people buying into wearing facial coverings, so we can get a hold on this and stabilize this. 
* Total tests conducted: 549,208 (PCR: 507,549, Serology: 41,592)
* Positivity Rate: 4.37% Now understand we calculate on a 7-day rolling average and depending on when your 7-day starts/ends or if you do a 14-day average or five day average then you get a different number. This is the consistent number that we use. We believe that it’s the right one. It goes up and down a little bit, but in the 4’s that is not where we want to be when we were in the 2’s recently. And also understand with that positivity rate we can’t attribute our number of positives simply to more testing. When we have more testing and more people testing positive, it means there's more of the virus out there, and we’re just learning about it, and I hope that we want to know as many people as possible that have it, so that we not only help treat them, but help them from spreading the virus to other people.
* Total hospitalized: 2,900
* Currently hospitalized: 532 - This is a worrisome number because it’s higher than it’s been, and it will oscillate a little bit. We still have a number of hospital beds out there. We aren’t at that critical point yet. That’s “yet”, 600 cases a day that can change pretty fast
* Total in ICU: 1,036
* Currently in ICU: 136
* Total recovered: 6,927
* New deaths today: 3 - Yes, the deaths are lower, it’s what we like to see but remember they lag by about 14 days or more from the announced cases.
* Total Deaths: 674
* New deaths by county: 95 M Shelby, 63 M Calloway, 91 F Casey
* All losses are a loss for Kentucky. Let’s light those houses up green and let’s ring those bells at 10am. This is a reminder that we are thinking of the Kentuckians we’ve lost, their families, and their communities. It’s the color of compassion and renewal as their souls move from their bodies to a better place.
* Racial breakdown of all cases: 77.55% Caucasian, 12.71% Black or African-American, 3.02% Asian, 6.01% Multiracial
* Ethnicity breakdown of all cases: 84.86% non-Hispanic and 84.86% Hispanic
* Racial breakdown of all deaths: 81.40% Caucasian, 14.63% Black or African-American, 1.43% Asian, 2.54% Multiracial
* Ethnicity breakdown of all deaths: 95.83% non-Hispanic and 15.14% Hispanic
* [Long Term Care Facilities](https://imgur.com/9fjS7uC): 7 new residents and 24 new staff positive from yesterday, and 6 more deaths, 1 new facility. 2,245 residents, 1,221 staff, 449 deaths, 234 facilities. 
* And so, folks where we are today and what we’re seeing is why we’re taking additional steps. Now know that there hasn't been enough time for when an infection occurs for us to see the results of the requirement to wear facial coverings. But that requirement will only work to stop the increase in cases if people do it. They can pretty much scientifically prove now that IF we can have 95% of people wearing them when they’re out, when they wear them when they’re within 6ft of other people,  it will work. It will absolutely work and we can do almost everything that we want to do. From saving lives to keeping the economy open- If we could do that and get this thing under control it will make what we can do in schools so much easier. But we need your buy-in to do it. Remember, everyone else is counting on us. This isn’t just us, getting in a car, determining If we want to wear a seat belt; if we get into that car, and if we don’t put ours on, 6 other people can’t put theirs on even if they wanted to- because you can be spreading the virus to them- and they can make the best decisions, but you’re still putting them in danger.
* So, to give you an update on steps that we have taken since we started to see this escalation, all the steps are one that have been proposed or talked about by the White House itself. These aren’t partisan, these are experts that work for a Republican president or a Democratic governor- and that other steps they are taking. [Number 1 is the requirement to wear a facial covering](https://imgur.com/CoIT705). [Number 2 is our Travel Advisory](https://imgur.com/aY2lknY). I need you to cancel your plans if you’re going to a beach to FL, AL, SC, or any of these states. And time and time and time again, we’ve now seen people come back from these vacations and spread it at their work, their church, in their weightroom, and other places. Shutting down academic endeavours. Let’s not do that and let’s understand where we are and where they are at a dangerous time and let's change our plans and try to find some other way, in KY or where it's safe- perhaps a different state though, we didn't set the bar very low- 15% is pretty dangerous- 10% is pretty dangerous. We are trying to make this as reasonable as possible for everybody. [Number 3 is now in social gatherings, and this doesn’t apply to any venue, to any church, to work, they have separate guidelines](https://imgur.com/4IWn7aI). This is your backyard barbeque, this is having friends over to your house, this is your block party. This is where it’s spreading and that means we are spreading it to our friends and to our neighbors because we let our guard down in these situations. This is also something the WH has suggested when you start seeing a surge- we gotta do it. It’s gonna help make sure that if someone comes over and maybe has it during that period- that it’s 10 or less people that we need to talk to to make sure they don’t spread it further. And let’s remember what’s at stake here. We talk about lives, we talk about $10B of our economy and we talk about schools and none of those are in doubt. We know we’ve got to get control of this virus to preserve all of that. [But if we look at the WH other recommendations](https://imgur.com/kN00FBv), 4 states that are surging, certainly worse than ours, you’d see a real blow to our bars and restaurants- which have already been through too much. I don’t want to have to do this. If we have a surge that is tough enough- you know, following the WH’s guidelines is something that we’d be expected to follow. I hope that our bars, our entertainment venues can operate safely, though it's incumbent on all of them, and if one of them isn't doing the right thing,  how it can impact so many people. So that’s the tough news.
* Good news is, we’re starting to see people's energy and enthusiasm in doing the right thing, picking up, so I’m bringing something back that we haven’t done in a while because people need to see it. Which reminds me- (Virginia signs in ASL) we’re going to get through this, we’re going to get through this together. We got a little positive social media, because it’s been so negative out there- and people trying to do the right thing, I know, have felt beaten down. Trust me, I understand how that feels. But this is going to give you a little bit of an idea of some things going on out there. Because we can’t see a lot of what is going on, out in our world right now. If you are like me, you are going from work to home, work to home, and Groundhog Day occurs day after day. 
* [But look at this, this is one of our recovery stories. Lillie, Mable, and Bonnie are all wearing big smiles because they beat COVID-19](https://imgur.com/ksjGNyd). Look at that, this is from 20 hours ago, when we pulled it, 3 survivors that got their green balloons. This is worth fighting for and I’ll tell you what, I don’t think I’ve ever met any of these women but I will wear a facial covering everyday to protect them, and I hope everybody else will too.
* [As school approaches, this is again, folks trying to lift spirits up](https://imgur.com/qNkfVVU). This is an 11year old- an 11-year-old! Trust me, I got one. And a 10 year old. There are ups and downs, but if they believe we can do this, and they know what it takes, and they can see rainbows in these days that we’re going through- We should be able too! You know, our kids mope a little bit but you know what? Then they get up and they do what it takes, they move on, and they find joy in what they can do. I just think we have to take a lesson from that for our perseverance, from what it’s going to take for us moving forward
* [This is one of my favorite performers- he’s in Lexington again showing how, they both, can show their own style, but also the fact that he is wearing a mask for others](https://imgur.com/vDLFF84). I know he has been through some tragedy lately and we are thinking about him for that.
* [Open, Healthy, Safe, and Clean](https://imgur.com/7x4n6nc). This is every workplace that we should be seeing, every approach we have. How can we be healthiest we can be today? How can we create the very best environment? All of us ought to be thinking about that each and every day. Here in the capital, we actually have a nursing staff that takes everyone’s temperature, Everyday, goes through the checklist. And I gotta tell you they’ve been an amazing addition here. Not just to keep us healthy, but to lift our spirits. They feel like as much of a part of the team as anybody that was here six months ago. While I hope there is one day where we don’t have to do temperature checks coming into the capital, we are going to miss them. They gave me a really nice card today that helped to lift my spirits.
* [You know where we say heroes don’t wear a cape, they wear a mask and we were talking about our healthcare professionals...now we’re talking about everybody](https://imgur.com/vAeFDo5). 
* [And here’s Berea- Just with an acknowledgement that we continue to lose people- that we need to continue to be compassionate and kind with other people](https://imgur.com/AW8PVYm). For those who are enforcing this requirement out there,  You’re doing the right thing, you’re helping to keep your businesses open, you’re protecting people’s lives. I know there are people that aren’t always nice to you, and for that I am deeply sorry. But we're calling on you right now to do an incredibly important thing and if someone is unkind to you because you do the right thing, it doesn't say anything about you, it says something about them and how they treat their fellow individual. And those that are frustrated by it? Don’t take it out on other people. They’re just trying to do what they need to do to keep their businesses open. 
* With today being the second largest number of cases I’m going to ask Dr. Stack to come up and comment on our trends and then right after that we will have the Lt. Governor give an update on education
* Dr. Stack takes over:
* Three things- the trends today that the governor mentioned-  these numbers today are not a surprise, they unfortunately validate where we are on this journey. Having nearly 700 new positives puts us solidly at the base of that escalation of that curve. It’s consistent with what we saw last week, where our numbers clearly broke out of a multi-month stable period. And so it’s a reminder to us to do these steps, we’ve got to take action, to be more disciplined about socially distancing, using our masks, and doing the things we know will work. I want to share two different thoughts here, over the last week as I interact with people and different topics come up, I just want to share information on 2 concepts:  One is, we would like to be as precise as we can in our interventions. But one of the ways that precision is not realistic is if we want to do things county-by-county, it just doesn’t work. So I’m going to put this in context for you. So this virus that we said didn’t exist until late last year, was an unknown entity in Wuhan China which is about 7,500 miles away from Lexington, KY where I live. That virus managed to make it’s way over to NYC in two months from China. Within a month and a half, NYC was under water with COVID infections overwhelming their hospitals. So, from Pikeville to Paducah is 375 miles on Apple maps. If we don’t think that the virus can’t get from Pikeville to Paducah in less than 2 months when it got from China to NYC which is about 7,000 miles apart in two months then I think we delude ourselves and we’re not being realistic. So to think that a city like Bowling Green, which has seen a recent rise, or Jefferson County, which encompasses Louisville, or any other area, can’t spread it’s infection over a county line or a couple of county lines very very quickly when people are as portable as we are- I think is just no consistent with reality and not consistent with the nature of this disease. So we will look into ways to be precise as we possibly can, so we can limit the impact as much as possible on our daily activities, But at this point in time, with the information that we have, and with the way the virus behaves we can’t be that precise. The other thing I wanted to share is people focus on, and at times assert, that there is  an attempt to fear monger related to this and I dispute that. I think we’ve been very balanced and very clear. It appears the vast majority of people, at least acutely, do just fine with this. But the problem is 15-20% of people are at high risk and if you’re in a higher risk category you don’t do just fine with it. If you are over 60, that accounts for 9/10 of our deaths by our current statistics. There are certain populations, and there are a large percent of the people of KY who are at high risk and can have a very terrible outcome. But I don’t want to just focus on mortality. There’s a lot we don’t know about this disease and so I want to put some of that into context. So I’m going to say other things: Chicken pox for kids a lot of times is a relatively benign disease, but it’s not completely benign some kids can have a bad outcome. So it’s a gift that can give again. So if you’re unlucky- and you have illness or an immune system problem you can have shingles. Shingles is a very painful rash that comes back in one nerve root. The virus never goes away, it just sort of hides. If you’re unlucky it can permanently damage the nerve and you can have really severe pain for an extended period of time. And there’s a herpes virus and the one that most people think about is cold sores perhaps, but herpes virus that’s a genital condition is something that there is no cure for- and if you are a pregnant female and deliver a child with an active outbreak, your newborn if they get infected with neonatal herpes, can have a 1 in 4 chance of dying. Hepatitis C is a viral infection as is hepatitis B, and the other ones. The early illness may have you laid up and sick initially, but largely your body compensates for it and takes care of it.  But it can reemerge decades later and cause cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer so that’s something that you may do fine with for a number of decades, could still shorten your life by a number of decades. Although now we have treatments that are curative but very expensive. HIV/AIDS, HIV has been with us since 1986, we still have no cure for it, and in the initial years and for quite a while, it was a disease we had very imperfect treatments for. If left untreated it destroys your immune systems and you die from overwhelming infection of other sorts. Now thankfully we have treatments that can suppress it and if you're compliant you can lead a full and productive life even with the illness. And the last one I’ll mention, is one of the rare instances where we have not fully eradicated it from the world but we have largely eradicated that, and it’s Polio. And Polio, and a famous American would be FDR, one of our former presidents, who was a vibrant youngman in his 20s, had an acute episode of polio and then was a paraplegic the rest of his life, and reliant on a wheelchair. So that could take someone who was vigorous and healthy and give them a permanent and severe disability. With SARS-COV-2, which is the name of the virus that causes COVID-19, we know that it causes stroke in some people, it causes severe inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)- it causes respiratory failure in many. In a number of individuals it is almost as if you’ve poured Drano in their lungs because they have permanent damage afterwards and multiple months of prolonged problems with low oxygen levels and difficulty recovering. It can cause blood clots in your lungs called pulmonary embolism. In kids we now know they don’t show any signs sometimes and then a couple of months later they develop a multi-system inflammatory syndrome that puts them up in the ICU and is very serious and threatening. And there are other issues like long-term cognitive impact or neurocognitive damage that we don’t fully understand, and of course it can cause a loss of sense of smell, which is a neurological problem, clearly involving the nervous system,  and this disease has only been around for 6 months. So those other illnesses we’ve known for decades and have catalogued what happens with people. This one has been around for 6 months, we don’t know what happens, we don’t know what the long term consequences are. I think people need to know that. Cause when we take the steps we are taking to protect Kentuckians, from this illness, it's because there's much we don’t know. What we do know, is terrifying for those that are most vulnerable to it. But we really don’t know the true extent of our vulnerability and who will ultimately be impacted or who will have long-term consequences. I don’t consider it fear mongering, I consider it informing. I think people need to be informed and there are a lot of reasons why people who devote their lives to public medicine and public health are very concerned about this infection and why we recommended the things we have in trying to protect you from it

**Headlines**

* 24,540 Cases (+518), 677 Deaths (+3), Positivity Rate: 4.92% (7-day rolling average)  
* New Cases by County: 83x Jefferson, 49x Warren, 34x Fayette, 24x Kenton, 22x Boone, 20x Barren, 19x Scott, 15x Hardin, 12x Campbell, 11x Laurel, 11x Perry, 10x Bullitt, 10x Franklin, 9x Daviess, 9x Madison, 8x Bell, 8x Graves, 8x McCracken, 8x Nelson, 7x Casey, 7x Jessamine, 7x Shelby, 6x Harrison, 6x Ohio, 6x Pike, 5x Bourbon, 5x Christian, 4x Calloway, 4x Greenup, 4x Marshall, 4x Muhlenberg, 4x Oldham, 4x Woodford, 3x Adair, 3x Boyd, 3x Carroll, 3x Larue, 3x Leslie, 3x Logan, 3x Webster, 2x Butler, 2x Carter, 2x Clay, 2x Gallatin, 2x Garrard, 2x Grayson, 2x Hancock, 2x Harlan, 2x Henry, 2x Hopkins, 2x Magoffin, 2x Martin, 2x Monroe, 2x Pulaski, 2x Rowan, 2x Whitley, 1x Allen, 1x Ballard, 1x Bath, 1x Carlisle, 1x Fulton, 1x Grant, 1x Hart, 1x Henderson, 1x Jackson, 1x Knox, 1x Lawrence, 1x Marion, 1x Mason, 1x McCreary, 1x Meade, 1x Mercer, 1x Metcalfe, 1x Owen, 1x Russell, 1x Trigg, 1x Washington, 1x Wayne
* New deaths by county: 49 F Simpson, 69 F Allen, 81 M Webster  
* Dr Stack: We can’t test our way out of poor decision making, we can’t test our way out of bad judgement. You can solve an infection with a test, you have to use a mask and social distancing to prevent it. As much as we continue to expand testing as much as we can, if people don’t take steps to self-isolate, wear masks, and socially distancing- we will run out (nationally and in the state). &lt;more below&gt;
* Dr. Stack: Remdesivir is still experimental. The Federal Government had been securing funding for it, but it’s now shifting to a purchase-approach which is more complex. A lot has been asked of state and local government and we are trying to figure out innovative ways for how to accomplish these things in short timelines. 
* Update on budget &lt;a LOT more below&gt;: With some taxes still waiting to be counted, General Funds collections are $11.46B. As of today we are only $4M in the red, but we expect to be outside of that.
* Is the 4.92% positivity rate the highest we’ve seen? -- At least the highest in the last 1-2 months. [Here’s the chart, it doesn't have our latest rates](https://imgur.com/OlJREDQ). It’s how many people out of a hundred- and it is saying that it’s spreading faster than it was previously. And I think our mask wearing, stopping our BBQs will help and have an impact. We’ve got to know it’s serious and it’s escalating. 4.92% is not acceptable.
* Are we able to get a number of people who are asymptomatic vs symptomatic? -- Not good ones- there are so many different symptoms. The only thing we can really get is how serious it can get with some people. The hospitalization data, the ICU data but that’s only if they got to the hospital. Some people have high tolerances while some people will end up in the hospital. I know there are some estimates out there nationally. But we’re going to learn eventually why it’s impacting some people more than others. There are some articles out there about blood type potentially having an impact but we don’t know and there are probably multiple factors that determine it.
* With the new travel advisory, how should colleges and universities handle students returning from those states? -- 1. Very carefully. 2. with robust testing. 3. making sure they have the medical staff ready to assist. They also should be talking to those students about limiting their exposure  with the outside world before they go back to campus. Those institutions are full of smart people working hard on those plans
* Louisville officials are saying not to get tested unless symptomatic or in a high risk category? -- I disagree, I think we have enough tests. If you are symptomatic- call your healthcare provider. Don’t wait for the Kroger drive through, seek immediate medical help. &lt;more below&gt;
* If we see a sharp uptick, where would you rollback? -- We will take the WH recommendations, rolling back restaurants to 25% and closing bars. If we have a surge we would have to do what the WH has recommended. We don’t want to do that. If you like your bars and restaurants, wear a mask to keep them open.
* Any concern about the availability of testing? -- We are not concerned right now about having kits and labs- we have a lot of labs that have stepped up. Will they be able to get their supplies? The reagent, the swabs? I’m not as concerned for the swabs as I am the reagent. &lt;more below&gt;

**Summarized (Full) Notes**

* It’s 4 o’clock, on this Wednesday, the time we come together everyday to get an update on the coronavirus and recommit ourselves. As we say every day: We will get through this, we will get through this together. (Andy signs in ASL) Say it with me: We will get through this, we will get through this together.
* Alright- good afternoon everybody, we’re doing our regular update in our battle against the coronavirus here in Kentucky. As we have talked about in previous days, we’re seeing an escalation here in KY. While it hasn’t reached the levels as in certain other states it is just so critical we do the right thing right now to prevent what has happened in other states. I know we’ve tried to give an update based on news stories and other things we are seeing in other states but today I have a more grim report. My family has been involved in the funeral home business, now it’s just my extended family but we still get reports from them. Today T learned there is at least 1 casket maker, that is having every single bit of its capacity sent to GA, AL, and TX right now. Not on the delivery trucks they're used to using but on 18-wheelers. Let’s make sure KY doesn’t end up in that position. What we are dealing with is life and death but the good news is we are taking the aggressive action that should work and if we can band together, get most Kentuckians wearing a facial covering and social distance we can prevent most situations from happening here. [And we’re acting faster than our neighboring states. OH and IN have now followed our lead in requiring facial coverings](https://imgur.com/n81pwNQ). This should show you this is the right step and that this is going to help. The fact that 2 neighboring states are doing it should make our response more effective. I respect both of these governors and I’m glad they took this step. We had talked on numerous occasions. Now this Ohio region requiring facial coverings should help us and show there is no political division in the right way to handle this. We all agree, the right thing right now to stop COVID is to wear a facial covering. This is not politics, it’s a public health tool that will keep our economy open and our kids back in school faster. Let’s make sure that we do it. 
* Positive cases today: 518
* Probable cases: 1,204
* Total confirmed cases: 24,540 - When we think about 518 cases, we remember the mortality rate being more than most in the country, that’s still people we don’t want to lose. 
* Children Under 5: 13 kids in 7 counties. 2 kids are 5-months old. 
* New Cases by County 83x Jefferson, 49x Warren, 34x Fayette, 24x Kenton, 22x Boone, 20x Barren, 19x Scott, 15x Hardin, 12x Campbell, 11x Laurel, 11x Perry, 10x Bullitt, 10x Franklin, 9x Daviess, 9x Madison, 8x Bell, 8x Graves, 8x McCracken, 8x Nelson, 7x Casey, 7x Jessamine, 7x Shelby, 6x Harrison, 6x Ohio, 6x Pike, 5x Bourbon, 5x Christian, 4x Calloway, 4x Greenup, 4x Marshall, 4x Muhlenberg, 4x Oldham, 4x Woodford, 3x Adair, 3x Boyd, 3x Carroll, 3x Larue, 3x Leslie, 3x Logan, 3x Webster, 2x Butler, 2x Carter, 2x Clay, 2x Gallatin, 2x Garrard, 2x Grayson, 2x Hancock, 2x Harlan, 2x Henry, 2x Hopkins, 2x Magoffin, 2x Martin, 2x Monroe, 2x Pulaski, 2x Rowan, 2x Whitley, 1x Allen, 1x Ballard, 1x Bath, 1x Carlisle, 1x Fulton, 1x Grant, 1x Hart, 1x Henderson, 1x Jackson, 1x Knox, 1x Lawrence, 1x Marion, 1x Mason, 1x McCreary, 1x Meade, 1x Mercer, 1x Metcalfe, 1x Owen, 1x Russell, 1x Trigg, 1x Washington, 1x Wayne 
* It’s spreading now in clusters. The asymptomatic person can spread it to 2-3 people. 
* Total tests conducted: 560,161 (PCR: 517,871, Serology: 42,223)
* Positivity Rate: 4.92% (7-day rolling average) that is a concern. It’s more people that are showing positive results. We know it’s spreading. 
* Total hospitalized: 2,914
* Currently hospitalized: 603
* Total in ICU: 1,039
* Currently in ICU: 145
* Total recovered: 7,000 - only reported what we get back (probably larger than this)
* New deaths today: 3
* Total Deaths: 677 - Sadly there may be a significant increase. When we see an increase in cases, we’ll see an increase in deaths. Let’s keep our efforts to lower these. 
* New deaths by county: 49 F Simpson, 69 F Allen, 81 M Webster  
* We’re going to be at this a while longer, there’s going to be more of a loss out there. Those families deserve our support. All losses are a loss for Kentucky. Let’s light those houses up green and let’s ring those bells at 10am. This is a reminder that we are thinking of the Kentuckians we’ve lost, their families, and their communities. It’s the color of compassion and renewal as their souls move from their bodies to a better place.
* Racial breakdown of all cases: 78.09% Caucasian, 12.43% Black or African-American, 2.92% Asian, 5.87% Multiracial
* Ethnicity breakdown of all cases: 84.70% non-Hispanic and 84.70% Hispanic
* Racial breakdown of all deaths: 81.36% Caucasian, 14.69% Black or African-American, 1.42% Asian, 2.53% Multiracial
* Ethnicity breakdown of all deaths: 95.85% non-Hispanic and 15.30% Hispanic
* [Long Term Care Facilities](https://imgur.com/Z3NMNpi): 31 new residents and 22 new staff positive from yesterday, and 2 more deaths. 2,276 residents, 1,243 staff, 451 deaths, 234 facilities
* [Day Care Facilities](https://imgur.com/HcGBL5F): 6 new facilities, 5 new staff, 3 new children. 36 facilities, 30 staff, 21 children, 
* We need a good testing program for our LTC facilities, which we’re implementing now. We can give them help. We’ve lost 3 staff members, we don’t want to lose anyone, but we don’t want to lose those who are helping 
* There's good news out there. We’re still waiting for the steps we’ve taken to have their impact. There are good signs out there. 
* Social Media:
* [116 days hospitalized, Ronda King (56) went home after fighting COVID-19, she was in a medically-induced coma. She was able to recover after receiving a plasma transfusion from a COVID-19 survivor. She went home yesterday and is thankful to the people who cared for her. She is looking forward to spending time with family. This is a story of triumph, compassion, and faith. I hope this celebrates those who are fighting, and those helping them. Our front line heroes in the hospital, rehab center, plasma donor, her husband, and her- those are all special stories. ](https://imgur.com/zCvJUDR)
* [Couple on a stay-cation. Not going to a place where we’re asking you to avoid- they’re wearing masks. They’re on a form of vacation- in Frankfort. They’re finding joy and following the rules. ](https://imgur.com/TUGdAjR)
* [Kid at a doctors appointment, doing what it takes- putting on a mask- and do not skip your doctor appointments! Make sure you go see your doctor and get the care that you need! We don’t want you to die of something other than COVID that was preventable. It is safe to go. ](https://imgur.com/Ukudw3a)
* [100th birthday at Presbyterian Homes Cedar Creek- Monday, July 20th- Geraldine. Today I wear a mask for Geraldine- hope that COVID is over by her 101st birthday. I hope that chain is a social-distancing line, so that people stay away. ](https://imgur.com/530j2dG)
* [I’m the first GSP governor- and this program changed my life. COVID has made it really challenging for these programs- these young leaders have adjusted, and I have had a zoom call with every one of these classes- They are amazing role models in their communities- They are forming friendships now that will last a lifetime](https://imgur.com/EXU5fIS)
* [What you see every single night in Frankfort- and I see it every day. It’s our capital lit up green. A reminder of our battle, and that we’re going to get through it, we’re going to get through it together. ](https://imgur.com/ZtwWhz8)
* Dr. Stack will give an update and then I’ll give an update on our budget: 
* I am going to remind people to tell you what we need to do but I will also be sharing an update on things I think are important. I have a grab bag of items to update today:
* Remdesivir is still experimental. The Federal Government had been securing funding for it, but it’s now shifting to a purchase-approach which is more complex. A lot has been asked of state and local government and we are trying to figure out innovative ways for how to accomplish these things in short timelines. I want to thank the many hospitals, working with us on getting a model to get 100% of our allocated medicine (from the federal government) to the state. We can’t get it done without these public-private partnerships
* On data: we’re getting a lot of data. It is imperfect and will always be but we commit to give you the best data we can. We will continue to be accountable. We are the repository for the official data. I don’t know how the other sites calculate their data. 
* For deaths: extreme example: if you’re in a car wreck, tested positive for COVID is it a COVID death? No. It would be an auto accident as the cause. We have a committee that looks at all the deaths and today they have removed some deaths after reviewing the data- we’re committed to being honest and open. If we say it is COVID related then that means we think COVID led to their demise. 
* On hospitals: people ask, if we’re trying to make it sound more alarmist- those states that have a steeper climb on their curve (TX, GA, TN, others), have said that their hopsials full. We have received transfers from other states to help them out. This is real. We’re committed to helping others, but we have to keep capacity open for Kentuckians too
* Testing: we have worked heroically to increase testing. We have come lightyears from where we came from. We can’t test our way out of poor decision making, we can’t test our way out of bad judgement. You can solve an infection with a test, you have to use a mask and social distancing to prevent it. As much as we continue to expand testing as much as we can, if people don’t take steps to self-isolate, wear masks, and socially distancing- we will run out (nationally and in the state). 
* If you feel you need medical care: get medical care. We know there are other needs- you have to take care of your other medical needs. Get your child’s vaccines. We don’t want children to have consequences from waiting. If you have a medical or surgical emergency (like a heart attack, stroke, appendicitis), don’t hesitate- got to the ER - seek their guidance- go get care. The hospitals are better prepared now, they are safer, and better supplices. We can control this, our curve is going up- but let me tell you, if it just turns into a little hill or mountain, will depend on Team Kentucky’s actions. It’s not too late. Hopefully the steps we’ve taken since July 5th will reflect that. We are in it for the long run. We’re all tired too. We’re committed to working for you- to keep you all safe. There’s a lot of data that shows that we have done well on this.
* Governor takes over:
* As we know, COVID has impacted almost every area of our lives, businesses, and our budgets. But we have good news, and a major concern. You may remember that we had the CFG (Consensus Forecasting Group) look at our fiscal year and on May 22nd they projected a $457M dollar shortfall. Since then, our exec cabinetry has been working to cut expenses. We’ve had significantly higher revenues, and we expect more by the end of this week when we close the books. The deadline to file taxes was July 15. We have a much clearer view of where we stand. We don’t have all the numbers in but when the book closes we might end the first fiscal year of me being governor with no shortfall at all. With some taxes still waiting to be counted, General Funds collections are $11.46B. As of today we are only $4M in the red, but we expect to be outside of that. Here is what I expect by the end of this fiscal year:
   * No budget cuts to K-12/Post-secondary education or health and public safety, health. We had asked some of those funds to be held back but they’re going to get those funds afterall.
   * No cuts to judicial or legislative branches
   * Expect to increase rainy day fund
   * Due to higher lottery sales, need-based student aid will receive $15M above what we had projected. If you were considering taking a gap year? I would highly encourage you to go to college and get a higher education, we need more 4-year graduates here in KY. More people with a skill and trade out there. Those without a college degree have lost their jobs 2x as much during the pandemic as those with one. 
* I want to thank our state agencies. I asked them to reduce their spending by 1% in the last two months, and they did better than that. They held back on hirings and discretionary expenses. Little good budgetary news. It looks like we won't have to have any budget reduction in our road fund
* Why that’s good- that’s from the last fiscal year the current fiscal year looks as dire, as we believed it would be. Our 4th quarter general revenue has declined by almost 8%. Worst fiscal quarter since the great recession. Road fund revenue also declined. While we would need a new estimate, the last estimate was a $1.1B shortfall, without federal assistance in a new CARES act, just like they did in the great recession, or changing the last CARES ACT to give us more flexibility to use that money, we will be looking at the largest budget cuts in history. But we know what we face without federal assistance is really rough. The vast majority of our budget is healthcare, education, and corrections costs (this one is hard to change). Who pays when we don’t have what we need? Those who need us the most, those are the people that pay when we have major cuts. It's’ never the time to have cuts in those areas. That’s an investment in our health and our future. 
* [The biggest threat to our budget is COVID-19, it’s people not wearing a mask causing our businesses to shut down](https://imgur.com/Xr600G5). We don’t want to do the WH accommodation of closing bars, reducing restaurant capability to 25%. That would lead to more layoffs. The lives we live depend on us. Do your part. 

**QUESTIONS**

* What was the last estimate for the next fiscal year cuts?  -- $1.1B. We got ranges, the smallest potential cut was 13-17% and it goes up to 30%, let me get you those numbers from Commissioner Hicks. If we had federal funding like we did during the last recession, which helped it not last as long, KY got $900M back then. We could close that hole with that money. If they can provide that money just during a recession, surely they can do it now with a recession and a pandemic.
* What is the status of the field hospital at the EXPO center? -- It is ready to go, we’d need a week to get it up and running, but it’s turnkey ready. Is it staffed daily? No, just security is out there. What is the cost? The daily cost to the facility is just rent. The expo is losing money now anyway. The main cost we had was renting the partitions and we removed them for now.
* Is the 4.92% positivity rate the highest we’ve seen? -- At least the highest in the last 1-2 months. [Here’s the chart, it doesn't have our latest rates](https://imgur.com/OlJREDQ). It’s how many people out of a hundred- and it is saying that it’s spreading faster than it was previously. And I think our mask wearing, stopping our BBQs will help and have an impact. We’ve got to know it’s serious and it’s escalating. 4.92% is not acceptable.
* Are we able to get a number of people who are asymptomatic vs symptomatic? -- Not good ones- there are so many different symptoms. The only thing we can really get is how serious it can get with some people. The hospitalization data, the ICU data but that’s only if they got to the hospital. Some people have high tolerances while some people will end up in the hospital. I know there are some estimates out there nationally. But we’re going to learn eventually why it’s impacting some people more than others. There are some articles out there about blood type potentially having an impact but we don’t know and there are probably multiple factors that determine it.
* With the new travel advisory, how should colleges and universities handle students returning from those states? -- 1. Very carefully. 2. with robust testing. 3. making sure they have the medical staff ready to assist. They also should be talking to those students about limiting their exposure  with the outside world before they go back to campus. Those institutions are full of smart people working hard on those plans
* E&amp;Y contract expires in a few days. There’s 44k-45k claims left. By Saturday, they’d have 30k claims left- is it going to be extended? -- Originally, they estimated, they could process 50k claims, they’ve worked hard, and extended hours. I think they'll hit that number. We’re looking at extending their contract. We’ll look at their numbers. It’s getting done faster than we were before. There’s a possibility we will extend it because we are getting more new claims filed. With the numbers reported to me, it looks like they’ll hit their targets. And if we extend it- other people have been trained in our system. I also think some other claims that are out there, people who have already got a few payments, those claims could be processed faster. I want to get caught up and stay caught up. 
* When did you last talk to McConnell about CARES money? -- It's probably been a month when we talked face-to-face, but we talk to his office every few days. We’re going to set up a call now that they're talking about it (more funding) again. I have concerns that there is not direct aid to states in the Republican plan. They're some positive things in there, like money for schools, but we don’t know what the limitations on that money will be. If the money is only for COVID-related expenses then that doesn’t help the cuts we are expecting to education. Let’s make sure if we want to save education that we actually save education. That required direct budgetary support.
* Working on followup on eviction and foreclosure? -- There’s a federal case, we’ve requested mediation. We need to make sure that people won’t be kicked out of their homes due to COVID. We also need to make sure people aren’t gaming the system if they have the ability to pay. I don’t want to set up an imbalance of power that hurts people who were impacted by COVID with unrealistic plans.
* Teachers I’m talking to are scared. The numbers will drive to the decision between NTI and in-person. They want their concerns considered? -- Yes they are being considered. We tried to immediately dispel the belief that “this doesn’t affect kids” and “opening schools is safe”. No. Kids can spread the virus and teachers would be exposed to a lot of contacts because of the kids. And we want to make sure that schools are safe for our teachers. I think about them everyday. If we don’t see a turnaround, they can expect strong recommendations from me about when in-person schools should start. I want them to know that I and the Lt Governor are thinking about you every day, and don’t want you to be put in an unsafe situation. Our teachers are being considered by this administration every day. If I were in your position I would be concerned too. 
* Folks who are worried that their claims not being processed will be missing out on the $600 CARES act money? -- I believe they will get the full UI, I’ll ask my legal department. I will say I think it’s a concerning time to stop the additional payment for UI, I don’t know what the number should be but you only get a fraction of your previous paycheck. People saying that they’re making more money on UI? -- If you just get a fraction of your salary and $600 makes it up… I worry about what you were making before and whether or not we are paying people what they are worth- well we know we aren’t paying people what they are worth but this is time when we can have true reflection on that. At a time we are asking these people to show up, look at our servers showing up, they are being brave. We need to take care of people a little better than we have.
* Louisville officials are saying not to get tested unless symptomatic or in a high risk category? -- I disagree, I think we have enough tests. If you are symptomatic- call your healthcare provider. Don’t wait for the Kroger drive through, seek immediate medical help. The drive thru needs to be open for everyone, contract tracing doesn’t work if we only know about the symptomatic people. I know there is a large appetite out there for testing now and we are working to increase our capacity. Our problem is that we’re having a logistical challenge (people to work the testing, label, send it, etc) but we are going to meet it.
* Needing additional flexibility on the CARES ACT money? -- We got about $1.6B with a lot of strings and stipulations, and specifically it can’t be used to replenish revenue directly lost by COVID-19. When we lose money it hits education and healthcare the hardest. There’s going to be a lot of places we won’t have the incoming revenue to make up for the loss. The best course would be a new round of funding specifically for our state and local governments. I’ve just talked about the state, but it's every local government, we’re all the same here, we all need the help. If they say that we can use the money from the previous round for budgetary needs, that would be helpful.
   * If they allowed it to be directly used? -- From what we have allocated we probably have in the hundreds of millions to be used. I’ll have to get your numbers. We’ll take anything that we can at this point. 
* Where are we seeing the sharpest increase of cases? -- More younger people testing positive, people under 40, we’re seeing an increase in kids under 5. We are testing more kids, part of that is more testing but I think they’re getting it more too. Our clusters, vacation, some business clusters, the Backyard BBQ, and some sports. We’re catching those, but we’re seeing bigger numbers in Lexington, Louisville, Warren, Barren. Previously we had seen a rapid increase in Warren but now it’s in a lot more places (the same kind of increase). Barren has a big increase now too.
* Protests, are you worried about people coming in from other states? -- I’m concerned. I hope they socially distance and wear masks. The ones I’ve seen are mostly about life and respect for life. A feeling that certain lives aren’t currently respected. My hope is that any protests going forward are making sure they’re protecting the lives of everyone there.
* Did you see UK’s proposal? -- I haven’t seen their plans yet but they have a robust testing plan. Dr. Stack said it properly: you can’t test your way out of it and a test doesn’t prevent an infection, a facial covering does. I thought their proposal was thoughtful and aggressive in a positive way.
* If we see a sharp uptick, where would you rollback? -- We will take the WH recommendations, rolling back restaurants to 25% and closing bars. If we have a surge we would have to do what the WH has recommended. We don’t want to do that. If you like your bars and restaurants, wear a mask to keep them open. 
* Are you going to wait for a 7-day period over 5% overall before you roll things back? -- We’re looking at a lot of indicators, not just positivity rate. We want to get to a point first to see if wearing the masks has made a difference- early next week. But if we see a sharp increase- we would act sooner. When you take an action you only see the results 14 days later.
* Any concern about the availability of testing? -- We are not concerned right now about having kits and labs- we have a lot of labs that have stepped up. Will they be able to get their supplies? The reagent, the swabs? I’m not as concerned for the swabs as I am the reagent. There's a huge demand for those things with the increases around the country. We’re concerned about it. We’re taking steps now. We’re making contracts with at least one lab in KY, and we want them to get the supplies they need. We are excited about where we are with PPE, but there’s still a shortage of N-95 masks. But we have a 2-3 month supply on hand to help our hospitals. 

**END QUESTIONS**

* Alright folks, we have gone just a little bit over time. Remember cases out there are still escalating. But today I’m hopeful. I know at different days, I've been in a different place but I’m hopeful. We’re seeing a lot of people doing the right thing. We’re seeing people coming around. We’re seeing people on the national stage wearing masks right now, and saying that it’s patriotic, and I hope that people are seeing that. Let’s make sure we’re doing what it takes. Se have the ability to protect those that we love, to make sure we have an economy that continues to rebuild. We have the ability to move closer to our kids getting back in school. It’s all on us. And let’s remember we’re connected to everybody.  Our failure to do the right thing, whether you believe it’s right or not- our failure to wear a facial covering and to stay 6 ft apart- doesn’t just affect us, it affects everyone around us. One of the best parts of my day today was talking to a big group of faith leaders and just listening to their perspective. They, like I, believe that doing the right thing here ought to be driven by our morals or our faith. Our belief that we have to treat others as ourselves. And that at a time when our actions can impact so many others, it’s truly living our faith. And there’s a difference between being led by your faith, which I believe is what’s happening here, and using your faith to get where you want to go. Our faith tells us to protect one another. Let’s make sure we do that. We’ll be back tomorrow, given the number of cases that are out there, we hope that this amount of information is helpful. And take care of yourself and take care of everybody else. Fill up social media with positive examples of what we’re doing. It does help other people. Thank y’all very much.

KEY POINTS

Republicans are considering extending the enhanced unemployment insurance through the end of the year at a drastically reduced level of $400 per month, or $100 a week. 

The current additional benefit of $600 per week expires at the end of July, but Democrats hope to extend it at least into next year.

They are going first to the states hardest hit so we will be lower on the list for those.

**Summarized (Full) Notes**

* Alright, It’s Thursday afternoon in the midst of the week starting on Sunday where we have seen some of our highest numbers of the coronavirus going all the way back to the start of dealing with this in KY on March the 6th and today is not an exception to that. But as we deal with all this, let’s remember that we know how to defeat this virus so we ought to breathe when we hear the results, we ought to not panic but it should make us committed to ensuring that we get back into the habits that help us defeat this virus.
* Today we are reporting 611 new cases, that makes today one of the highest days, though certainly in the last week we’ve had all but one of the highest we had on record. Can we stop the escalation? Can we force a plateau? Yes by reducing our get-togethers down to 10 people, canceling vacations to states with a high positive rate, wearing a facial covering, keeping more distance, so that we can stop it where it is, to not see the devastation that other southern states are seeing.  
* Positive cases today: 611
* Probable cases: 1,265 - We are required to report these numbers by the federal government
* Total confirmed cases: 25,147
* Children Under 5: 21 Kids, A disturbing trend. 13 different counties. Kids can get this virus, we know that- and we have a greater duty- to wear those facial coverings- to protect those innocents. 
* New Cases by County: 116x Jefferson, 49x Warren, 32x Oldham, 28x Fayette, 27x Boyle, 19x Harlan, 19x Laurel, 17x Bell, 16x Kenton, 14x Campbell, 14x Graves, 13x Christian, 13x Daviess, 12x Jessamine, 12x Scott, 10x Hardin, 10x Ohio, 9x Boone, 9x Henderson, 8x Bullitt, 8x Madison, 7x Pike, 6x Trigg, 5x Carroll, 5x Clay, 5x Floyd, 5x Monroe, 5x Whitley, 4x Barren, 4x Henry, 4x Hopkins, 4x Knox, 4x Larue, 4x Logan, 4x Nelson, 4x Shelby, 3x Boyd, 3x Calloway, 3x Casey, 3x Franklin, 3x Gallatin, 3x Knott, 3x Leslie, 3x McCracken, 3x Meade, 3x Montgomery, 3x Perry, 2x Edmonson, 2x Fleming, 2x Grayson, 2x Harrison, 2x Letcher, 2x Marshall, 2x Mercer, 2x Muhlenberg, 2x Simpson, 2x Spencer, 2x Union, 2x Washington, 2x Wayne, 2x Webster, 1x Anderson, 1x Bath, 1x Breckinridge, 1x Butler, 1x Carter, 1x Crittenden, 1x Garrard, 1x Hancock, 1x Hart, 1x Jackson, 1x Johnson, 1x Lawrence, 1x Lewis, 1x Livingston, 1x Lyon, 1x Magoffin, 1x Marion, 1x Nicholas, 1x Owen, 1x Owsley, 1x Woodford, 4x Unconfirmed
* Total tests conducted: 565,490 (PCR: 523,530, Serology: 41,859)
* Positivity Rate: 4.94% Pretty similar to yesterday, but gone up about 2% from 2-3  weeks. If we want to get it under control, we should want this number to go down. Which would show we are lessening the spread in KY 
* Total hospitalized: 2,921
* Currently hospitalized: 581 - Good news (number reported from hospitals)
* Total in ICU: 1,040
* Currently in ICU: 135
* Total recovered: 7,046
* New deaths today: 7
* Total Deaths: 684
* New deaths by county: 49 F Fayette, 57 F Jefferson, 64 F Knox, 88 F Ohio, 68 F Whitley, 60 F Casey, 89 F Ohio
* While we see our cases going up, we are still generally in a good place in our hospital bed, ICU, and ventilatory capacity. But when cases escalate, we can quickly run out. We don’t want to be like the other states that are seeing devastation. 
* The facial covering numbers haven’t shown in our results yet, but reports from Harlan look promising.
* All losses are a loss for Kentucky. Let’s light those houses up green and let’s ring those bells at 10am. We have a long term employee from the Secretary’s XXW office, who rings the bell 120 times every day, 1 for each county. This is a reminder that we are thinking of the Kentuckians we’ve lost, their families, and their communities. It’s the color of compassion and renewal as their souls move from their bodies to a better place.
* Racial breakdown of all cases: 77.81% Caucasian, 12.57% Black or African-American, 2.92% Asian, 6.00% Multiracial
* Ethnicity breakdown of all cases: 84.93% non-Hispanic and 15.07% Hispanic
* Racial breakdown of all deaths: 81.35% Caucasian, 14.73% Black or African-American, 1.41% Asian, 2.51% Multiracial
* Ethnicity breakdown of all deaths: 95.89% non-Hispanic and 4.11% Hispanic
* [Long Term Care Facilities](https://imgur.com/A3fsDkm): 20 new residents and 6 new staff positive from yesterday, and 1 more death (staff member), 4 new facilities. 2,296 residents, 1,249 staff, 452 deaths, 238 facilities
* [Day Care Facilities](https://imgur.com/hscei00): 0 new facilities, 1 new staff, 4 new children. 36 facilities, 31 staff, 25 children, we continue to see the numbers go up, but the plans in place should be helping to taper off the new cases. We will take any actions we have to to stop the escalation.
* Next week we want to look at some of the age trends and distributions. A larger portion has shifted to those under 40. But it’s in all age groups. As we’re testing more age groups, we’re finding more positives. No one is immune, no one is less likely to get it by age. Let’s make sure we take care of ourselves and others. 
* We need good news- We do see more people that have realized it is time to get excited about Team Kentucky and do the right things. We are in a different place than in early March and  that means we don't have to go through what we did in March. 
* [Return of chalk art- at a time when we’re asking people to do less. Fewer contacts, fewer house parties, fewer people over. I know that my family has done less- It’s the right thing to do especially with the concern of where the virus is now.](https://imgur.com/hLfIlGi)
* [WKU- Hilltopper wearing a facial covering, 1. Protect lives. 2. Protect economy, 3. Trying to get schools open. ](https://imgur.com/iq52pNr)
* [Behind the scenes look at a library and how they handle the books, they are keeping them in quarantine for 4 days- this is the ingenuity, understanding enough of the virus, to make sure our kids are safe- and still continue to spread knowledge. Great example. ](https://imgur.com/SbyppMy)
* [This is our media- we’ve asked our media to make sure they’re showing the public and world that they’re living up to their responsibility to wear a facial covering- we appreciate that. It’s a partnership between everybody ](https://imgur.com/BMJxYKw)
* [I thought this was heartfelt- Denise is feeling what we’re all feeling: the difficulty, the anxiety, the loss, and she felt the compassion- just having the green lights out there, helped people feel better](https://imgur.com/ND7Lixd)
* Sec Friedlander takes over:
* I want to talk about LTC facilitated today, first I want to thank the Fed Gov for their partnership, they have announced there will be an additional $5B going to nursing facilities and vertern facilities across the country to help with PPE and testing. They’ve also announced over the next several months, they’d provide some rapid testing equipment, this will take a couple of months. They are providing 50k of those. They are going first to the states hardest hit so we will be lower on the list for those. 
* In the interim, we’re working with our LTC TaskForce, including a medical ethicist- that task force has provided guidelines, today I signed a contract- to allow labs to bill us directly for maintenance testing of staff and residents at all nursing facilities across KY. what they’re asking them to do is to test staff every 2 weeks, or more if someone tested positive. Our guidance is up on the KY COVID website. If you’re a lab- you can contact us directly. It should be ready and up by tomorrow. We continue to want to support our nursing facilities. We’re glad that we’re partnering with the Fed Gov and we want our plans to dovetail theirs so we can have a consistent program and keep our folks safe. We do think that we should be able to provide the means to do that and that’s what we’re announcing today. 
* Gov takes over:
* With that additional testing, there’s been different terms, we’re calling maintenance testing. We are going to be living up to the absolute best practices to protect our LTC facilities. We are testing when there are outbreaks and maintenance testing. Some states have done one or the other, a few have done both, we are doing both- I think everyone is moving in that direction. This is one of the biggest danger zones for the virus and that’s both on the federal and state level where they are provided PPE and guidance. 

**QUESTIONS**

* Universities dealing with students coming from states with outbreaks- can you go into details, overall plans? -- We talked yesterday about a case plan yesterday and I’ve talked to Dr. Stack a little after the press conference yesterday. I think it’s fair to say it’s still in flux, trying to establish the best procedures, we want robust testing for our universities, but we’re going to face limitations on the testing side based on what we see to the south. We’re worried we’re going to see a scarcity of the reagent. I referred to that wrong yesterday, it’s not the medium you put your sample in to send to the lab, it’s the medium they use directly in the lab to process the kits. Universities have a lot of brainpower and that’s a positive thing. For folks coming in, from states where there’s a concern- they should limit their outside contact before they come back to campus. When they get there? They should be looking at their dorms, bathrooms, those types of things. Then looking at your classrooms. When I was in college some classes were smaller, but then you have some 101 classes with hundreds of students. There are challenges there. Then there is: How to proceed once you’re there- testing and how do you ensure you have a safe environment. It’s a big challenge but I know there is a lot of planning going into it.
* Today there’s news out of UK requested by students to remove the “Rupp” from “Rupp Arena”. Do you think it should be changed, what is your opinion on that? -- I want to read what they’re saying before I form an opinion. 
* Weddings? -- Weddings at a venue or a group/business/entity that has other guidance are not limited by the 10 person limit. At home though, we don't have that same guarantee for sanitation or mask wearing so we ask if you are going to do it at home you really look at limiting the amount. I see a lot of people that are safely asking the question “Do we want to have it now? If we go around the guidelines and this thing is spread at our wedding what will that do to how we feel about it?” And long-term, what does it mean to us as a couple for celebrating on that day? I don’t anticipate that anyone would necessarily be fined, but I would be especially careful because COVID could ruin what is supposed to be a great day.
   * &lt;Followup, inaudible&gt; -- There’s a direct financial interest for businesses to follow these guidelines. If you have an outbreak at one of your facilities you will have to cancel weddings for the next 1-2 weeks. That same incentive/disincentive isn’t really there for homes. 
* Do I see a date when you’ll be caught up on UI claims? -- My current goal is to get caught up on current claims but we've talked about an aging system, a system designed to fail. We’ve talked about how you’ve got to apply, then get a letter of acceptance, request your payments, and then do that every 2 weeks. I believe it’s designed to get a disincentive there. In the time of a great economy maybe that’s a discussion to have, but it makes it really hard now. So I believe there will be a time when we’ll be caught up on initial claims, our hope is that problems with the 2nd or 3rd payments will be easier to deal with- we may have to extend E&amp;Y contact. And they have helped us out with more than they promised to, they've passed the 50k claims by the end of day today. Our goal is to get caught up and stay caught up. Just the numbers this week show you can get caught up then get behind almost immediately. 
* You’ve called the numbers this week “disturbing trend with children under 5” what do you think is behind that trend and have you given any thought to not opening preschools/kindergarten and opening middle/high schools? -- We are seeing this trend which we think is real but we didn’t have these ages of kids being tested a month ago. 4 months ago we didn’t have anyone being tested. We are dealing with a virus we first saw in KY in March and the first sets of tests in March didn’t work, we’re learning things about it. There’s just 1 study out- it might suggest that kids under 10 can’t really spread it. I saw today, and this is me listening to someone that read the study - I didn’t read the study, where there may have only been 40 kids &lt;10 years old in the study. It’s tough, we are making decisions based on limited information on a new virus. Now when we’re seeing it in clusters in daycares we hope it stays low. We’re actually seeing it in high school athletes a lot too. 
* UK reported a few dozen false positives due to a computer glitch. Also people that went to get tested and got tired of waiting in line and they got back positive results. How can we be sure we are getting accurate numbers? -- That’s the only report from a lab that we have had that happen to. None of us want that to happen. It was only 26 out of 30k tests. We’ve done 500k tests in KY since March 6th, there are going to be issues. We will go back and dedup, and use the committee to look at our death numbers. I think when you look at the overall numbers they are relatively accurate for the range we are in. With something this new, there’s going to be 26 out of 30k that have problems. &lt;follow up, inaudible&gt; we do believe the numbers are generally accurate. There is human error here as well, someone entering a number wrong. I believe it’s generally reliable and Dr. Stack wants to talk about it too:
   * Dr. Stack: there was an issue with some of the testing locations, where if you sign up and didn't get a test, you’d still get an email that says your test was incomplete, that said “Your recent COVID test return result was incomplete. This could occur if there was a problem with how the sample was taken or you created a test voucher but did not complete the test”. The details and the facts matter. If you just read the top of the email you might get the wrong impression 
   * &lt;follow up, inaudible&gt; -- The data has imperfections, it always had and always will, but nothing that the governor has said has undermined my confidence in that data. All of that I remain comfortable with, yes
* &lt;inaudible&gt; You’ve said next week is a do-or-die time, what else are you taking action on? -- [There is one more that the WH suggested here](https://imgur.com/vDF4tS4), if we continue to see escalation instead of a plateau we will be looking at that. I don’t expect, but I would be very happy if next week saw a decrease. We have 3 on this list &lt;the slide&gt; but there was 4th, the Federal Government also recommended we go down to 10-person gatherings which we have done. If we go from 600 to 800 or 900 next week, we might have to do some of those things. We don’t want to. There’s a lot of people that will suffer, and we don’t want to do that. That's a lot of small businesses that may have to lay people off or close. But if we have an escalation we cannot ignore the advice out there from the WH and the experts. We would look at others as well. We are looking for the maximum impact on reducing the virus with the smallest impact on our economy. 
* JCPS switched to distance-learning, Fayette Superintendent recommends the same. Would you be surprised if a lot of districts will do that? -- They’re our largest districts, and they have a unique challenge : the level of bussing, number of students in the building, so I’m not surprised by that. I also wouldn’t be surprised to see one of two things happen in other districts, either a move to start to distance learning, or move the starting week back a few weeks. The challenge is right now we have an escalation but will we see a stabilization, or a decline based on the steps we have taken? If we don’t see a stabilization next week I’ll recommend that if you start in early August that you at least push back to see if we can get it under control. If I think there’s a good plan in place I will send my kids to in-person learning. I want to see us stop these numbers from increasing, I want to see schools spread kids out, I do want to make sure that if they can’t be 6ft apart then they wear a facial covering.
* Are we seeing any issues in nursing homes, with false positives- with any effects on their staff? -- I don’t think we’ve seen that in any of our nursing homes. I will say that 1 staff member is 1 positive too many. Even a false positive should be enough to make us say “whoa” because of the devastating effects of it spreading in these types of facilities. We are also concerned about having staffing in these facilities. When we started testing there were some that said “Wait a minute, if we have a number of positives from our staff, we won’t have any help”. That’s a concern, but we gotta know if people have it so we can take the right steps. That is why we put together that task force, to have the resource to come in and help. There are areas in this, where if I could go back we might have done something different but I believe our response in LTC facilities has been one of the better in the country.
* Sending kids back to school, a lot of parents are also teachers- If you were a public school teacher in KY would you go back into the classroom? -- Today? No. I want to see where we are early next week. If we go from 600 to 900, it will show you where it's going and we will have recommendations from there.
   * They’re running out of time though- I know, that’s why we’re talking about early next week. That’s the thing about the virus, it doesn’t care for our schedules. We have to look at changing our decisions, we need to be more flexible and fluid than we were before. Businesses have had to deal with and now schools will too. I know we all want more certainty in life but this virus is just not giving it to us.
* Are you planning to send the NG to Louisville for the demonstrations/militia? -- No, our only request is for some specialty decontamination groups. They haven’t been requested. As to when Cameron makes the decision, we haven’t seen any request there. That decision will always be based on the overall safety of the community. Any announcement will be handled with care- with facts, reasoning, and process are released. I think when you have a total void of those it makes it really hard for people to comprehend and accept. We raise our kids to want to know “why”, my hope is that a lot of thought and care will be put into an announcement and explanation. 
* Long term availability for childcare? -- Yes I’m worried about it. It is a mean and vicious virus. I know the cabinet has provided over $47M to help prop up that industry, and now Sec Friedlander will make sure that I’ve given a good answer:
   * Sec. Friedlander: we know we have reduced capacity, we have surveyed Childcare facilities across the state. As of today we know we have 20% that have not reopened of both certified and licensed units. Also we have reduced group size so there is a limited capacity across our system. We continue to have discussions on the best way to proceed and how we can provide some additional services but those are still very initial discussions. 
   * Gov: All I’ll add, if we’re in a place where it's unsafe to send 30 kids in a classroom with a teacher, it’s unsafe to send 30 kids to a daycare with a daycare worker. The virus works the same in both, I’m a big supporter of childcare but I’ve had to make some tough decisions. The ramifications aren’t lost on me. 
* Will pooled testing help? -- Dr. Stack: This doesn’t change the patient’s experience, what it does is that they can take 10 people and sample them together, and if they’re all negative, they’re all negative. If someone or multiple people are positive, they would only have to re-run those 10. If you have 2 that are positive out of 100 you would run 10 tests of 10 in each group and then when 2 groups came back positive you would run 20 more tests with all the individuals in the groups that tested positive to see who is really positive. This saves the overall usage of the chemicals needed to test. This only works when the positivity rate is lower or you don’t end up saving much in the end.
* Your thoughts on Study from UL that says 4-6x more people have it and didn't know it. Would the mortality rate be less? -- I haven’t seen today. I’m going to go off of what you said- what it would mean to me is that the virus would be even more widespread than the testing indicates and that there are more asymptomatic individuals, and that those asymptomatic individuals could spread this. Yes that would knock down the mortality rate expect we might then have people passing away COVID-related that we don’t know because they aren’t being tested. Do I think more people have it than we know? Yes. Does that mean the mortality rate is lower then? Quite possibly, but does it mean it can spread even faster than we know? I think that’s true too. 
* Chief Justice put out an order denying your motion to remove a Judge? --  I think the population can understand why we did that- it was a strange place to file a case there, they’re normally filed in Franklin circuit- instead it was filed in Scott county. After we had been in a couple of hearings, someone sent us a pic from the judge's social media where they are standing with one of the plaintiffs that said, “my friend Ryan Quarles”. We didn’t know they were friends and hadn’t been told that. Now the judge has since responded and said, “sure that was posted but they don’t have a close personal relationship.'' But I think anybody that’s in court that saw something like that could say “hey, wait a minute, everybody deserves a fair trial” and the chief justice, looking at all the information, thinks we can get a fair hearing, so we’ll move ahead. Given everything we’d seen, our expectation is that the judge will be professional like we are, we’ll be able to move beyond it, ultimately it’s going to be decided by the supreme court now, as they've already stated. Certainly our hope is that if we have another hearing that we follow the rules of evidence, that it is focused on the issues that we are actually arguing about, but at the end of the day the position that we should invalidate all the steps that we’ve taken to stop this virus- won’t just cost us lives, it would devastate our school systems, by removing all their NTI days, so Jefferson county’s decision to start remotely, they couldn’t do. It would cut all the funding because it’s based on the number of kids that go in, it would eliminate worker’s comp for our front line workers that are needed to quarantine, it would be devastating. We’re hearing from employer after employer that they support the facial covering requirements, that they believe it’s what is going to keep them in business. They believe the study that $10B of our economy is relying on this. 
* Challenge to smaller Universities to test all their students? -- That is going to be a real challenge. They probably won’t all be able to test every student that shows up. The question is, Dr. Stack said it better- you can’t test yourself out of the virus, it just tells you if you have the virus. I think the most important thing our universities can do is to put the policy and procedures in place that spread people out, require social distancing, require facial covering, don't have everyone in a high capacity dorm, the classrooms will be the same- Then you need some monitoring program on the testing. Some models out there are saying if you have faculty tested on a regular basis you get some idea of what the spread is on campus. But again it’s a challenge. When you look at the rest of the state, but smaller- how do you prevent it from going further? Each university, their physical presence is different, their student population is different, they all face different challenges but they have a lot of resources, brainpower, and we’re going to give them a lot of flexibility too. Their ability to react and respond quickly, gives them an advantage over some other entities. 

**END QUESTIONS**

* Again, high numbers today, but I'm hopeful. I’m hopeful again, from what we're seeing out there, that we’re taking this seriously, and we’re  going to do what it takes to stop this. Next couple of days are going to be really important- the data we see early next week is going to drive a lot of decisions, but remember we’re going to get through this and we're going to get through this together. Now, we got a pretty fun ending today. So one thing we asked, given that what we know how important facial coverings are, is for members of our media and outside of it, whether it is to make PSAs or put out photos, that encourage folks to do it. [So today, we’ve got Tom Ackerman of LEX18, stepping up to have a little bit of fun wearing a facial covering](https://youtu.be/yN161m0yshQ?t=3518).

She explained she was trying to reach her niece to check on her because she was in quarantine because her sister had passed from Covid. I expressed my sympathies and explained how to correct the number to reach her niece and again we bid each other to take care....but I can’t stop thinking about this family.

I don’t know their names and the calls have never been more than 30 seconds, but my heart is breaking for them. I feel like I know someone who has passed from Covid and I’m grieving for this family of strangers.

Coronaviruslouisiana,WizardMama,Community Updates / Rule Explanation on Misinformation &amp; Disharmonious Actions,"# Some community updates...

Last week u/Voxicious had to step down from their moderator position due to an increasing amount of responsibilities from home and work which made continued moderation untenable. Voxicious was integral to moderation during the early days of this subreddit so we are all sad to see them go. 

On the same day, completely unrelated, there was some confusion around a particular user not being permanently banned. This is a subreddit focused on the coronavirus in Louisiana, and as such we are also a Louisiana focused community not just a strictly scientific one. **Our goal is to create a subreddit where you can find scientific information pertinent to Louisiana** ***and*** **a location to come and get your questions answered, voice your concerns, and/or converse with a virtual community about the coronavirus in Louisiana.** As such, freedom of speech is an integral part of our community. 

Also around the same time, traffic to this subreddit began to increase *massively*. Since the beginning of July, we have nearly doubled our viewership. For all of June, we had a little over 153,000 page views for the month so an average of 5,000 a day. For July (aside from the 4th when we saw a noticeable decrease) we are now averaging around 10,00 pageviews a day. 

With all of the above, there is a need to clarify the following for new members, old members, and those who are lurking. 

# Misinformation

There are members who may not agree with mandates or current health policies, but they have every right to express their disagreement. This is not misinformation and this type of conversation will continue to be allowed. When it comes to direct misinformation our policy has been slightly modified. Previously, it was up to each moderator to determine if something was misinformation thus warranted removal. While that will still be happening this subreddit has also implemented the AutoModerator feature. Certain key phrases (for example “masks don’t work”) will be automatically flagged by the Autmod for moderator approval. Why aren’t these automatically removed? Well, there are many instances where the previous statement is completely valid and those types of comments will be approved. The goal is not to silence a narrative, but to enhance the quality of information available in this community. You are more than free to express your opinion or belief, but you must be clear that is your belief and not just provide a direct statement that cannot be backed up by credible sourcing. If you feel you are being unfairly targeted by this, please contact the moderators directly, or feel free to make a public comment. Only select phrases are flagged for review, not specific users. 

To further combat misinformation in this community a WIKI page will be put together to address misinformation directly. If there is a certain subject you would like addressed or a particular question/concern you are consistently being presented with please let me know below. For instance, maybe you are hearing that cases are high because the same people tested multiple times and count for multiple cases (not true), or cases are rising because of the increase in testing and not the spread of the virus (also not true).

# Disharmony / Trolling in the Community

As for disharmony, the vast majority of those *that are vocal in this subreddit* believe in mask-wearing, mitigation protocols, and are well-versed in information about the coronavirus. However, this is not the case for a majority of Louisiana. It is the goal of this moderator team to have this subreddit be a reflection of Louisiana and not just a group of likeminded people. It is also the belief of this moderator team that not only is the freedom to express ones beliefs integral, but this expression also provides opportunities for education. Every question to the status quo, or disagreement, provides an opportunity to provide resources that may not have previously been known. **It is true that trolls may never agree with the information provided, but it also allows an opportunity to provide ya’ll with information to give to your co-workers, friends or family members who may not agree with mitigation protocols, health guidelines, or may not even believe the virus exists at all because they haven’t been provided adequate information.** On top of that, these comments almost act as a pop quiz for the subreddit with some of the most informed comments in the community coming in response to these disharmonious comments.

Then there is how the very functionality of Reddit is based around being able to vote your opinion on comments. The members of this subreddit do an excellent job downvoting the information that you do not want to been or do not agree with. In many instances, the only way fo these type of comment to be viewed is if you willingly choose to open them. Additionally, if you are signed into Reddit you have the option to mute or block specific members so you never have to see their content. 

# Rudeness / Hostility / Profanity / Spamming

It does not matter who it is from, and especially who it may be directed towards, outright rudeness, hostility, or aggressive profanity will not be tolerated in this subreddit. If you need clarification on what this means the rules of the community are outlined on the sidebar or the About section of the app. Automoderator has been activated to automatically delete any comments that contain outright offensive language. The policy remains the same. You are more than welcome to edit your comment to be more polite, alert us of the change, and we will reapprove it. These are stressful times and sometimes emotions get the best of us. Please feel free to contact us if the Autmod got erroneously removed from your post.

Spamming will not be tolerated and will result in a 3-day ban. Lately, multiple members have taken it upon themselves to spam the same comment, emojis, or extremely similar ones on nearly every comment of a singular user. Not only is this targeted harassment but it causes a great deal of additional work for me, u/wizardmama when I have to individually remove each offensive comment. Some comments go multiple levels deep and it takes quite a long time to remove them all. While the user you are doing this against can simply press “read all message” in their inbox. Please, I beg of you, do not do this. 

# How Permanent Banning’s Work in this Subreddit

We are not a ban happy moderator team, as it currently stands we have 3 accounts that have been permanently banned, with one of the accounts being a bot that auto responded “wash your hands!” to EVERY post and nearly every comment. Aside from bots, no one is outright permanently banned by a singular moderator. It is up to each moderator’s personal discretion if a soft ban is warranted. A soft ban is a temporary ban that typically lasts 3+ days. Once your soft ban is lifted, the next time you do an action that is worthy of a banning you will be given a warning and reminder of your last ban. If you have been given a warning and then display behavior that is worthy of banning you will be considered for a permanent ban. If you display any behavior that is outright grievous in nature (threats of direct physical violence, doxxing, etc.) you will be soft banned while moderators consider a permanent ban. If you violate the rules to the extent that a permanent ban is considered the moderator team will discuss before permanently banning anyone. 

If you have any concerns about this update, please feel free to contact the mod team, but please remember we are only human and are doing the best we can. 

Don't forget to wash your hands, and mask up!

Your Mod Team,

The way to get people to wear mask is through positive reinforcement. 

Firstly, They look cool. It is like a ninja society. 

Second, it blocks facial recognition technology. Which is great if you are paranoid about the government. 

Thirdly, No one knows how ugly you are so now we are collectively 10% more attractive. (wish it could be more but there are only some many miracles I can pray for. ) 

Fourthly, It is a great reminder about how bad your breath is so gum sales should go up. So it stimulates the economy (big gum is behind all of this) 

Fifth, Save money on make up.

# Practice healthy behaviors to protect yourself and slow the spread of COVID-19
     * Wash your hands before entering and after leaving the polling location.
     * While in the polling location, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol frequently, especially after touching surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles or voting machines.
     * Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in lined trash cans. Wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.
     * **Wear a cloth face covering**. Children under 2 and anyone who has trouble breathing, is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance should not wear a cloth face covering.
     * Maintain at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) of distance from others. It is important to continue social distancing even when you and others are wearing cloth face coverings.
- Consider voting alternatives available in your jurisdiction that minimize contact. Voting alternatives that limit the number of people you come in contact with or the amount of time you are in contact with others can help reduce the spread of COVID-19.
- **Do not disinfect or wipe down the voting equipment yourself.** Electronic voting equipment can be damaged by cleaners and disinfectants.
     * If you use hand sanitizer before touching the voting equipment, ensure your hands are completely dry to avoid damaging the equipment.
     * Wash your hands or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer after using the voting equipment.

# Avoid crowds
- Vote at off-peak times, such as mid-morning.
If driving to the polls and your schedule allows, monitor the voter line from your car and join it when it’s shorter.

# Be prepared
- Check your voting location and requirements in advance because they may have changed due to COVID-19.
- Verify your voter registration information is correct in advance of reporting to the polling location.
Contact your local or state election officeexternal icon for additional information for voters with disabilities.
- Make sure you have all necessary documents to avoid delays at the polling location.
- If possible, complete any registration forms prior to arriving at the polling location.
- Where possible, review or complete a sample ballot at home to speed the process of casting your ballot at the polling location.
- Bring your own black ink pen.
- **Bring a stylus or similar object for use with touchscreen voting machines. Check with poll workers before using.**

Put in the common-sense steps that flattened the curve here in Louisiana before and will slow the spread and flatten the curve again. Wash your hands. Practice good hygiene. Wear a Mask. Wear a Mask whenever local and state authorities say it is indicated or whenever social distancing is not possible. Each and every one of us has a role to play and we will continue to be able to open up. I know Governor you made a decision to pause reopening to stay at Phase 2 and we support your decision in that regard. We will continue to flow testing and resources to support the implementation of your policy. I want to ensure everyone in Lousiana and everyone looking on we reopening up America again, and we are dealing with the rise in cases across the sunbelt. It is not either-or. We do not have to choose between opening up our economy, making plans to open our schools, and doing what each of us needs to do to open up and slow the spread. Here in Louisiana, you did it before and we are confident you will be able to do it again. Here in Louisiana, you know what the American people know we are all in this together.** I read a verse in my devotions this morning that is called ""run the race that is marked out for us with endurance and faith."" I am confident that with the endurance and faith of this great state and nation we will every day be one day closer to putting this coronavirus in the past. We pledge to work your governor, leaders in DC, and great health workers of this state to hasten that day.

* **It will take EVERY SINGLE PERSON TO WEAR A MASK. IT WILL TAKE ALL RESIDENTS TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE, PRACTICE GOOD HYGIENE.**

   * **Social gathering of more than 10 people right now is especially difficult with the type of stead Louisiana has.** (*Mod note than why are we allowing 50 people to a gathering?*)

* Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Austria, South Korea, Japan, even Vietnam have opened up their schools and have done so safely. So can America and so should America.
* We have lost 30 precious lives to the virus to kids under the age of 15. That is 30 too many but our kids are not as susceptible as adults. If we use our heads we can open our schools safely. Not opening our schools will do our children so much more harm than the coronavirus ever can.

* Critical we re-open our schools.

**Besty DeVos**

* Thanks to Vice President Pence and President Trump.
* Kids have to get back to school.
* Not a matter of if, just a matter of how.
* So many ways we can think outside of the box and address specific needs.
   * The question of a child's health is multidimensional.
* Know kids have been harmed being at home these past months.
   * Wellbeing, Mental, social, growth.
   * Most vulnerable are harmed by not being in their classroom or around their peers.
* Americans can-do spirit. This is a great opportunity for adults to step up and show grit and determination to ensure kids can continue their learning come Fall.
* Looks forward to seeing all of the creative solutions across the country.

# Questions

*Could you expand on lessons learned from the first wave and why you are so confident Louisiana is better off than it was in March as we take the steps to open schools?*

American people were inspired by the leadership by the people of Louisiana's collaboration that slowed the spread and flattened the curve. From early on in the pandemic, New Orleans was not far behind the North East and we saw numbers moving very quickly. Because of the steps, the governor took and testing resources the Fed was able to deploy we faltered the curve. Confident the people of Louisiana will be able to do it again. The rise in cases that are happening all across the Sunbelt is serious but the people of Louisiana can be comforted to know we are in s strong position to provide the testing equipment, and medicines to save lives, and equip our healthcare workers to adequately combat the virus. This is possible through the systems set up by the President like the Air Bridge to create masks, gloves, and gowns. Very soon we will have constructed 100,000 ventilators in 100 days.  When you look at how we have expanded testing, and the hundred of millions PPE supplies that are very strong across Louisiana, and you look ate progress we made developing treatments like Remdesivir and convalescent plasma the American people can be encouraged that while we were there for you before, we made sure you had the resources, testing, and personnel, to see you through the first spike we are in a much better place today.

*Can you be more specific about the school's reopening? Will it be virtual? In-person? Mixture?*

JBE: Very encouraged Louisiana is opening K-12 schools on time. As many for in-person instruction on campus as we can safely do. The board is determining rules and they will be decimated down to the schools systems. Has not reviewed them so no comment. However, we will follow the CDC guidelines. Must focus on mask usage. Universal mask usage will be critically important for the safety of the children and especially the adult. IT will be a combo of viral and in-person instruction. Some may be a hybrid where you are in person on Tuesday but virtual on Wednesday. This will not be without controversy but this what the situation demands. We will open our schools, Lord willing, on time just about a month from now.

Pence: As early as March has provided guidance to schools for reopening. We anticipate later this week CDC will issue additional guidance for parents and operation of facilities. We do not want CDC guidance to be a reason people do not open their schools. We will respect any decisions made on campuses. Across the state of Louisiana, we will put the health of kids and family first. We know the risk the coronavirus presents to people under the age of 18 is very low. But we want to protect faculty and families from possible exposure by the kids. President Trump has said it and we say it again we have to get our kids back in the classroom.

*How do you see football happening at the university level?*

Pence: Confident universities can reopen campuses and restart sports programs. It's important for the students and also for America. I don't need to tell the SEC fans that America loves football. We love our sports. WE are prepared to work with athletic directors to makes sure they have the support and resources and guidance to be able to move forward. The coaching staff at LSU have been back at the campus for months and athletes for weeks. They are taking precautions to keep them safe.

*Gov. Has issued a state-wide mask mandate do you think that is appropriate? Do you think it is appropriate for K-12 schools or college campuses*

Pence: Some of the CDC guidance encourages children and faculty to wear masks where social distancing is not possible. As for the governor's mask mandate we support states and the decisions that are made on a state by state basis. The reality is many states and counties across the country where wearing a mask is not necessary. However, it has always been important to recognize the unique circumstance of each state and each community. **This is why I came here today to make it clear to the people of Louisiana that we support the Governor's decisions and to heed the guidance of health authors. As for wearing a mask, it is always a good idea to wear mask, wash your hands, practice good hygiene, socially distance to slow the spread and put others first.**

*Enormous backlog for testing across the country. Just hold from Dr. Birx that we should not have social gatherings of more than 10 people in areas with surges. Internal documents also show the stockpile is incredibly thin. With these circumstances how is it possible for the Trump administration to say that people go back to school. What happens to the larger districts that say they won't go back to school will funding be withheld*

Pence: Some of your facts are wrong. The national stockpile is quite strong and getting stronger every day. Close to 60,000 ventilators alone that are on hand. We monitor the availability of PPE very closely, not only on a statewide basis but on hospital systems. We will continue to ensure we have a strong amount of PPE. However, with the rise in cases, there has been a greater demand for testing. Admiral Jerrod will speak to that issue because we are encouraging the pooling of testing which will allow multiple samples to be tested at the same time. This will allow us to scale testing at a rapid rate. Louisiana is demonstrating today that you can continue to open your economy, make plans to open the schools and do what is necessary to flatten the curve if all of us continue to do our part. Make to mistake when it comes to schools some 60,000 pediatricians across the country said that kids are better off overall in school than out of school. The risk to people under the age of 18 is very low. However, services for kids with special needs are delivered by an large at our schools. We need to make sure we are taking care of our kids and meeting all of their needs while making sure working families can get back to the workforce, especially single parents, we need to reopen our schools.

Admiral Jerrod: Today's date almost 42 million tests have been run in this country. Approx. 25% of those tests come back in 15 minutes. Another 25% are done at hospital labs and returned with one shift to 24 hours. So we are talking about 50% of the testing that is done at the commercial labs. We follow all of the states every morning, many states county by county, there is no state that the average return is over 5 days. Yes, there are outliers, but the great majority of that 50% are coming back within the 5-day window. SO what are we doing to address this?

1. We are actively working on pooling technologies that are being implemented right now at the large commercial labs. That means 4 or 5 tests done at a single time to greatly decrease turnaround times.
2. 4-5 million tests per month are just from nursing homes going to commercial labs so this will go from multiple day turnaround to 15 minutes and will also take the burden off the lab.
3. By September and October Point of Care, tests will dominate the market.

In the ideal world, everyone will have a result when they take the test we will constantly improve the turnaround times. So to recap, half of the tests within 24 hours, 25% of that 50% are done within 15 minutes and we are continuing to move int hat direction.

75% of states have 60 days in their state sticklike. 75% of all hospitals have 15 days in their supplies, and they continually get supplies. &lt;2% have 3 days or less of PPE and we focus on those hospitals.

*VP Pence*

If you receive unemployment and are unemployed due to COVID-19, then please be aware the federal weekly payments of $600 will end the week of July 25th. You will not receive payment for the final week of July due to the how Louisiana issues unemployment benefits.  

Let's put pressure on our senators to continue these payments.  Covid-19 hasn't gone away,  it appears to be strengthening yet again,  and the citizens of Louisiana affected by this pandemic do not deserve to have federal support during this time ended.  While I hope our economy recovers quickly I do not want to risk infection of myself or my family because I must seek employment next month.  And at what cost? If infected I will no longer be able to continue working and be in an even worse position.  Please,  let's pressure our reps to do the right thing, the Christian thing,  and continue federal PUA unemployment benefits. 

Thanks and I will post links to both Senators web pages to facilitate contacting them.  If they hear from enough of us they WILL LISTEN!!!",3,1594835903,louisianna,2020-07-15 13:58:23

&gt;UPDATE: As of today, information on our [\#COVID19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hashtag_click) dashboard will be updated at noon daily except on Saturdays. The next update will occur tomorrow (Sunday) at noon.

From [nola.com](https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_ad3ce0fa-c902-11ea-85a7-f7d34363af40.html)

&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health will no longer be updating its [coronavirus](https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/) dashboard on Saturdays in **an effort to ease the burden on the department and testing labs.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Numbers from Saturday will be included in Sunday's totals.  
&gt;  
&gt;LDH typically updates its dashboard every day at noon with new totals for cases, deaths, hospitalizations and people on ventilators.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of noon Friday, more than 88,000 people in the state have had the virus and 3,399 people have died.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nearly a million commercial tests have been collected statewide.

# Summary

^(NOTE: The summary of today's conference is transcribed LIVE. The summary may contain spelling and grammatical errors which until it is able to be corrected once the conference concludes.) 

**Gov John Bel Edwards**

- COVID-19 press conferences are back to occurring two times per week. They will now take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays moving forward. No meeting tomorrow.
- 96,583 COVID-19 cases in total have reported in Louisiana since the beginning.
**We are now #2 in the country for cases per capita but are closing upon New York who is #1.**
- Today we report 1,737 new cases and 36 new deaths,  the largest single-day increase in deaths since May 22. 
- Largest amount of hospitalization since May.
- Exceeded our monthly testing goal by almost twice! (The goal was 200,000).
   * Our testing effort is at the top of the country for per capita tests especially for an increase in testing for the month of July.
   * Since the beginning of the emergency we have done over 1.1 million tests. 
- Tested 33,000 since surge testing was brought to Louisiana.
- Adding a surge testing site to Alexandria.
- Surge testing should be open till the end of July / we exhaust the tests the Government has provided us.
- Some people may get an email to get tested after they have gotten tested. This happens because some people pre-register multiple times and it confuses the system.
- Community spread is still a problem in Louisiana and we are seeing high-incidences as defined by the CDC across the state. 
- Also seeing positivity factors in excess of 10% across the state.
- About 1/3 of recent tests come from those 29 and under and today over 90% came from the community.
- As of the 15th of July, all regions have had a 7 day average of greater than 10% case positivity rate with the most recent being 14.6% positive.
- Hospitalizations are in an upward trajectory in all regions of the state in Louisiana. 
   * We only have  so many doctors, nurses, and the ability to save a life is limited. The effects everyone whether you are seeking care for COVID19, a stroke, heart attack, etc.
- All regions are showing a downward trajectory in incidences in cases. This more likely than not represents a lag in the receipt of case results.
   * Will see incidences go up.
- All regions are not an effective reproductive rate of greater than 1 indicating that COVID infection requiring hospitalizations are increasing across Louisiana.
   * This is widespread across the state.
- **Phase 2 extended 2 more weeks** will look at data over the next 2 weeks to see where we go from here.

**Dr. Billioux**

- Seeing a statewide issue with COVID.
- Used to see some regions going in a decent direction, that is not the case right now, we are seeing a tremendous amount of COVID and a tremendous amount of spread across the state.
- Even the people showing up to the emergency departments are increasing statewide and staying elevating compared to other reasons people are coming to emergency departments.
- Testing has increased dramatically over time.
- Initially saw decreases in case positivity rates under 10% now we are at 14.6% as of the 15th of July.
- Seeing a decrease in incidence but believe it is due to a decrease in test results coming back with some people seeing a delay of 7-14 days to get results. The true incidence is being pushed back further, and we are concerned the decrease in incidence will turn into an increase as more cases come in.
- We are seeing a high level of daily cases and will continue to.
- Hospitalizations have turned a corner in the wrong direction and we are seeing a steady rise in cases statewide.
   * Not just COVID also people who are delayed care.
- Region 4 looks similar to the state elevated COVID-like illness, testing increases, a high percentage of case positivity, cases that were in the upswing but now trending downward but will probably trend upwards once more cases get filled in. The level of hospitalizations is nearly double what was seen in the first wave in March/April.
   * Several hospitals are having problems admitting patients, seeing them in the hospital, and are transferring them to other regions.
- Same pattern in Region 5. Lots of people showing up in the ER, more case positivity, steep spike in cases, and more recently flattening or decreasing we'll see if that stays steady as more cases get returned. Hospitalizations are also double than what was previously seen in those regions during the first wave.
- Fully supports mask mandates across all parishes. No parishes meet the CDC guidelines. Decrease crowd gatherings. Close bars. And wants to citizens to limit their exposure to people in under to 6ft distance. Wear a mask wherever you go.
- Hopefully, we will see a leveling off of cases in a week's time.
- Will continue to meet with hospital leadership to makes sure capacity is not jeopardized. 

#Questions

*Will bars remain closed to indoor service without foodservice?*

Yes.

*Are we ready to open schools?*

From our perspective, we are still looking at a day-by-day basis. We still are awaiting CDC guidance on what should be done on a national level for schools. If we see we are starting to have cases decrease and see measures we put in place a week ago begin to have an effect we will act. It is too early to have a recommendation but we look at the data. 

*Do you know when the recommendation will come with 2 weeks before school is open?*

The recommendation on when to move forward with schools with be had with the governor, department of education, and local leaders. But with the work we've done over the past couple of months with school leadership and the dept. of education to we have formulated a plan so we know what plans to have in place [for each phase we now need to know] what is the timing schools open. Local leadership is also considering that data as well. We want to makes sure that we know what school will look like depending on Phase [we are at and that that plan is ready to be triggered] depending on what is going on at that time. 

*Previously we were informed that some regions were considering canceling non-essential procedures. What does that look like now?*

Hospital leadership is dialing in capacity depending on what they are seeing in their areas. We are seeing some hospitals defer those surgeries if they aren’t too necessary and try to reduce the elective procedures. Keep in mind another elective visit is seeing your doctor for your blood pressure reading, so if doctor can do that procedure in their office as opposed to a hospital, and they have the capacity to do so, we want people to get their regular maintenance care. Someone who gets outpatient care for their heart failure is not going to need to get a surgical bed or ICU bed. 

*So the decision is left up the hospitals on an individual basis*

Yes, hospital leadership are making those types of decisions with our support.

*We hear problems with the ICU units is a lack of nurses and not so much ICU beds, will the state try to boost the staffing with out of the region nurses?*

If there is any sort of benefit to being in the position we are in now is that we have done this before. We have a variety of of tools we are able to reactivate. We can bring in staffing contracts from other parts of the country. We know that neighboring states will be unable to shift their staff because they are also being affected by a large caseload. 

*A lot of schools are starting in a hybrid way partially virtual partially in school. DO you support that decision by the teachers or should in-person education be delayed for little longer*

We know this will be a challenging school year regardless. We do not want to do anything that will make it more challenging than it already is. Making the switch from distance to in person and visa versus is not an easy one to make. We have been having broad-ranging discussions to make sure schools are doing parallel contingency planning so no matter what the situation is in their region they can provide some accommodations to students. LDH does not have a switch that we dictate whether schools start or not. We provide information to the governor who provides that information to local leadership.

*What is the update on the convention center in New Orleans? Do you plan on using it? Or do you plan to do other similar sites across the state*

We still have capacity but I am not sure how much. We are looking at a variety of different opportunities. Keep in mind those places are to reduce stress on the hospitals when they are reaching capacity and less so for new acute patients. If hospitals are seeing a lot of new patients but not seeing compression issues we need to make sure they have the staff to take care of those types of cases vs medical monitoring which are people who have stayed in the hospital for longer [and the typical patients in the convention center].
   * Encourages the public to donate their plasma if they have had COVID19.
- Still have significant capacity at the medical monitoring location if that needs to be duplicated somewhere else depends on what is going on in the ground in that particular location.

*Hearing different situations in testing across the state. Different subs? Self swabbing? Why is there not a uniform procedure on how the tests are done? Can accuracy be trusted?*

Even if the swab is slightly different in diameter everything has been validated. When we are talking about having to do large volume tests you may need to use different swab sizes at different locations. As for timing, we are using a uniform procedure, so you have a slightly different experience depending on each person you are with, but the protocol is uniform, and the place tests are being tested is uniform as well.

*Schools are planning to open for in-person education in a couple of weeks to a month, is this safe for them to open?*

There is not an easy answer to that. When we look at kids we believe they are at lower risk for poor outcomes from COVID. We are seeing a surge in cases in the young age group but not as many deaths as we saw with the older age group. However, we are seeing an increase in the number of people in the young age group going to the hospital. We do not want to see more kids have health risks due to exposure to COVID. The larger risk is for the teachers and who the kids return home to. How do we operate in a way the reduces the likelihood that if a student has COVID they would be less likely to spread it to others? Medically there is no easy way answer to say yes you have school, no you don't have school... what we *can* say is that education is critical and we need to be able to do this work in person or virtual. From a public health standpoint, we give advice on how to reduce the risk to the public as much as possible.

**Governor John Bel Edwards**

- I'm sure you will recall the BESE came up with the guidelines last week. They did it based on a variety of contingencies primarily based on if we will begin Phase 1, 2, 3, and how schools will operate if we transition in the various Phases.
- So whatever Phase we are in 2 weeks is how schools will open. 
- School districts are currently deciding when they will open for instruction if they open initially in person instruction or if that comes later.
- We are seeing one district choosing to open on time as distancing learning but transitioning to in person by Labor Day and another making a different decision. You will see a variety of how school districts decide to open.
- BESE coordinated all of the plans with the Office of Public Health following CDC Guidelines which is why they included a mask mandate as part of their guidelines.
   * Redfield said if you open schools in states like Louisiana mask usage is incredibly important. He talked about universal mask usage.
- With respect to staffing a week before last Gov Edwards was on a call with 18-20 hospital CEOS and directors, they identified 3 primary concerns. a) adequate access to Remdesivir. b) decrease testing turn around times. 3) staffing.
   * Started talking to those hospitals who raised staffing issues and when the VP was here we raised that issue to him.
   * Made a FEMA request for medical personnel. The request is currently pending.
   * Looking at other options such as contracting to bring staffing into the state.
   * Difficult thing to do because the medical professionals are needed where they are, and there is an acute widespread need for staffing, so its harder to get them to come here than it was last time.
   * Morial Convention center is set up with 250 beds. Staffing is on had to cover 60 beds. With the ability to quickly expand staffing to an additional 60 beds. Today we have more than 20 inpatients at the convention center. These patients do not require an ICU or ventilator, but cannot go home yet. 
- Staying in Phase 2 includes the mask mandate, bar closures to on-premises consumption o alcohol. Limitation to 50 people for a social gathering.
- 1 week is not enough time to determine the success of various mitigation measures. We have not had enough time to see the result of the mask mandate and restrictions from last week. Want to go another 2 weeks.
- Recent modeling by the WH Taskforce shows we do not need to go back to Phase 1 or Phase 0 to flatten the curve. We can get to an r0 of &amp;amp;lt;1 if we wear masks. 
   * Birx says, when you have a wide-spread high-incidence like seen in Louisiana only a centralized state mandate will work. Bars need to be closed. No one wants to do that but it is essential if you are going to flatten the curve. Finally, the crowd size of gatherings must be decreased as well. Stay home when you are sick. Abide by physically distancing. You are safer at home than anywhere else.
- If you decrease the number of times you are out and about you are decreasing your likelihood to become infected.
- These decisions are not made lightly but they are based on data.
- We know there are a lot of of people who are in need. The rental assistance program had 25 million dollars for 7,500 people but more than 40,000 people applied. Not all will be eligible, but we had to stop taking additional applications while we work to fund the remainder of the need the best we can. Looking at block grant funding or ASG. HUD has not made the funding available yet but we know it will be made available soon. Will continue o look to other CARES Act funding. For updates sign up at LARentHelp.com
- The front-line worker program has had over 189,000 applications with funding available to 200,000. 
- Paid out 4.8 billion in unemployment assistance/compensation to Louisiana with 2/3 coming from the Federal government.
  * $600 weekly benefit is set to expire at the end of the month.
  * Congress is discussing extending it.
- Saw a drop in unemployment to 9.7%, this is a drop of 4.5 points. Still a lot of unemployment.
- The best, fastest, and surest way to get more businesses open is to flatten the curve and get a handle on the virus as best as we can. We need to do the mitigation measures. Wear your mask. Social distance. Wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. 
- We know it works we've done it before and we can do it again. Tremendous confidence in the people of Louisiana.

*Tropical Disturbance*
- Located on Northside of Cuba moving into Gulf today. Current tracks take the system towards Texas but we anticipate SE Louisiana may begin to feel heavy wind and rain by Wednesday. 
- Please stay tuned for updates.

Conclusion:
- The virus is the enemy we are not each other's enemy.

#Questions

*AG Landry and you have great differences. Is he still participated int eh untied command group meetings*

He is not to my knowledge. There is an individual from the AGS office who gets the opportunity to brief or listen to the daily update and facts, but he has not personally participated in my knowledge. He may be listening, but he has not participated.

*As cases continue to surge with no indication they are going down is it ethical that we are seeing schools still consider virtual options as we see cases hover where they are*

Yes, as they try to get the mix right with how many they want on-campus vs how many they want to do distance learning or the hybrid situation where they do some by virtual or some by distance, and when to start. Do we have all of these school districts working extremely hard to follow the guidelines and they are going to make decisions that are in their best interest. We will work with them and source them the best we can, whether it is PPE or the information they seek. This is a very difficult task they have. Our school districts are learning from one another, as well as other states, to get kids back safely into the classrooms. You have to strike the right balance between public health and the education of our kids. That is what we are trying to do, using science and the best information we can get from the CDC. We continue to be impressed with how school districts are doing this. As you see cases rising you will see some districts choose to start virtually and that is the flexibility they all have.

*So you have no expectation to make a statewide decision?*

No, the BESE board came up with guidelines based on whatever Phase we are in at any given time. So there is a broad range of contingencies there that inform such thing like how many kids can be on the bus to how many kids can be in a classroom room, etc. So we will make decisions in the Governor's office based on the gating criteria we have been asked to look at. We will make the announcement as early as we can. Over the next week, I plan to meet with a variety of stakeholders in our school systems to makes sure I receive their feedback and hear their concerns. This is not an easy situation for any part of the state of Louisiana. 

*We're in Phase 2 until a couple of days before we start... should schools prepare as if we will be in Phase 2?*

Schools should prepare to be in whatever Phase we could be in. It will be dependent on the data we have between now and then, but if people follow the mitigation protocols we will bend the curve again. But I cannot tell you what things will look like on a certain date. This is why schools came up with guidelines to deal with each Phase of reopening. If I was a school leader I would put most of the concerted effort, considering we are currently in Phase 2 to start in Phase 2, but I cannot guarantee we will be in Phase 2. It is my hope and expectation that we do not go backward, but we will do what is necessary to make sure we do not exceed the capacity of our hospitals.

*Recommendations by the WH request closing gyms, reduce gatherings, etc. Now that you have seen hose recommendations why not tighten up regulations to be aligned with that the WH is recommending*

The biggest part of the recommendations were things I put in place before the White House Taskforce officially revised the guidelines. Although, at the time, they were telling us to do the mask mandates and close the bars. We are looking to get further clarification on the occupancy size of restaurants and other locations. For example, 25% in occupancy vs 50%. We currently say it up to 50% but you have to be able to able to socially distance with those that are not apart of our household. So we believe the modeling that says 25% is really based on the ability to socially distance, which is already part of our current restriction at 50%. So we do not feel the need to change from 50% to 25% because we are already requiring restaurants to makes sure people are adequately socially distanced at 50%. So unless we get further information to change from 50% to 25% we will not because we already require restaurants to make sure people are already socially distanced. Contact tracing we have done does not show significant relation to gyms causing outbreaks, unlike bars which were the number one venue where outbreaks occurred. This is true even though bars were closed down in Phase 1 but in Phase 2, when they opened, they were the driving force behind the most cases we see we look at outbreak locations. If we continue to learn anything that suggest we need to take additional measures, or that we can ease restrictions on certain venues, we will do that. We are working hard to use the data and guidelines to strike the right balance here in Louisiana.

*In terms of additional healthcare facilities is that something you are considering doing in other parts of the state?*

Everything is under consideration, but we would have tremendous difficulty staffing new facilities that are constructed that are created outside the existing footprint of our hospitals. So that is not our first effort. One of the things I'm happy we decided months ago is that hospitals around the state created additional permanent capacity for surge beds. It greatly exceeds what was previously available. I think it's about 350 beds around the state of Louisiana that are in existence today that didn't exist before. At LCMC they have a couple of hundred beds that are not ICU beds but can be quickly transitioned to beds. But we still need to figure out the staffing, which is easier to do within an existing hospital footprint. We may need to set up the hospital that was previously set up in Region 2 by the Navy to figure out what kind of staffing we can get from existing hospitals. It is much easier to surge in an existing hospital when staffing is the challenge.

*BESE recommends that Grade 3 and above should wear masks as much as possible does that strike the right balance between an outright mandate and basically recommendation that kids wear masks?*

It does because I view it as a mandate and I believe it is recommended for children younger than that to do it but without a mandate. Obviously the younger the child is the more difficult it is to have them wear a mask appropriately. Anecdotally, I was watching a North Carolina Kindergarten teacher explain on TV that she was afraid children would not be able to wear a mask but after she went through it one time with the children, they did it, and it hasn't been a problem. So, we will see. When you look at the guidance from BESE it is exactly right. I interpret it as a mandate for those that do not have a health condition that prevents the individuals form wearing a mask. 

Closing remarks
- I have faith that we can flatten the curve. WE have done it before, we can do it again. This depends on EVERYONE doing their part. 
- Wear a mask. Wash your hands often. Practice physical distancing. Stay home when you are sick.

# Summary

* Today Louisiana passes the 100,000 case benchmark with 101,650 cases being reported. These are only the cases we know about. These are cases with a positive test result. There are undoubtedly more cases out there, not everyone who is symptomatic has been tested, and we know that between 20-45% of people with COVID19 are asymptomatic and do not generally get tested. We know that there is more COVID out there than those that test positive.
* 2,408 new cases reported since yesterday.
* Today we report +16 new deaths, for a total of 3,574. Yesterday we reported 60 new deaths, the highest single-day report of COVID-19 deaths since May. We know deaths sometimes lag behind other numbers. No matter how you slice it up these numbers are very troubling.
* In the month of July, we have reported over 400,000+ tests and have greatly expanded our testing in Louisiana and are #1 for the month of July for testing per capita in the country.
* We know we have a high prevalence of COVID19 across the state of Louisiana.
* I hope that hitting the 100k benchmark shows people we are in a public health emergency, not one that was declared by the Governor himself on his own accord, but one that is happening. This number should be sobering.
* Cases are increasing across the state and this is why we are remaining in Phase 2. The mask mandate, limitation of bars, reduction of crowd size limitation to 50 people for social gatherings will continue.
* We are nowhere we want to be in Louisiana. We do not want to have to go back to Phase 1 or Phase 0. However, we cannot lose our capacity to provide life-saving healthcare in our hospitals, which his why we have restrictions in place.
* We have every reason to believe that if we can get universal compliance with face coverings, social distancing, washing hands, cutting down on travel, with people staying home more often, Lousiana can flatten the curve without having to go back into Phase 1 or Phase 0.
* You can recall how previously I said that 3 parishes met the were not considered an area of high-incidence of COVID-19 by CDC's standards, and thus met the qualifications to opt-out of the mask mandate? **There are currently no parishes that are not in the high-incidence of COVID-19 category.**
* The latest resurgence has impacted the ability of our healthcare systems.
* OLOL has taken a two-week pause in performing non-emergency medical procedures that require inpatient beds to makes sure they have the beds, and more importantly the staff, they need for COVID19 patients.
* Hospitalizations have increased all over the state in Louisiana there I, not one region where it decreasing. Especially concerned for Regions 4,5,6.
* Hospitalizations have increased by +4 for a total of 1,585 COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized across Louisiana.

**Dr. Amanda Logue, chief medical officer at Lafayette General Health System**

* Lafayette General Health is the largest healthcare provider for Acadiana but with the volume, they are seeing of COVID19 cases, they are not able to take care of their own community let alone expand services outside.
* Actively taking care of patients, and surging as they need to, but are quickly running out space.
* Had to transfers patients to Rapides, Baton Rouge, Northern Lousiana, even Mississippi.
* Had to decline 87% of requests of transfers into our health system. That is not normal. Do not have the capability or space to take care of them.
* Please come to the ER if you need to, do not be afraid to come to seek medical services. We will be here if you need us.
* Main campus, largest hospital, Lafayette General Medical Center 1/2 of ICU, and 1/3 of non-ICU beds have patients fighting COVID19.
* On May 27th we had 15 COVID 19 patients and yesterday we had 105.
* In our whole 5 acute hospital system, we have had 143 patients and that number was only 20 six weeks ago
* Seeing the rapid increase in community spread and hospitalizations that follows the community spread.
* Please to Acadiana to understand the impact of widespread community outbreaks impacts the hospital system.
* Moving elective surges off of the main campus and canceling some altogether. This is the last thing we want to do, some patients are still waiting for surgeries that were canceled in April.
* Hospitals are full and the ICU is full.
* Some beds are closed due to illnesses to staff.
* Do not have enough nurses to staff the beds right now.
* Thankful for the nursing teams but the level they are working at right now it unsustainable.
* COVID19 has not replaced the typical volume of pattens we normally have like health attacks, strokes, etc. but when you add COVID on top of that it is unsustainable. Normally we can do both, but not when there are surges to this degree.
* The only way to prevent recurring surges is to truly flatten the curve once and for all.
* Follow the guidelines. Wash your hands. Physically distance from one another. Avoid large crowds. Wear a mask when you leave the house
* If you are elder or high risk be especially careful and stay home if you don't have to be out.
* Impacting not only COVID19 patients but anyone who wants to seek care in Acadiana.

**Dr. Henry Kaufman, chief medical officer at Our Lady of Lourdes**

* OLOL the hospital is full and ICU is near complete capacity.
* This significantly affects normal operations.
   * for 2 weeks OLOL has almost completely eliminated elective surgeries.
   * This means if your cardiologist recommends you need a heart bypass or early-stage cancer those operations will be deferred.
* Still dealing with the aftermath of people coming in with later stages of diseases due to having to wait from the first surge.
   * Some people weren't able to get tests they would have, like mammograms, and now they are at later stages than what they would have been caught if these elective procedures weren't postponed.
   * 100s if not 1,000s of women have not been able to get their mammograms and he is worried there is the hidden impact completely unrelated to COVID that we haven't appreciated yet.
* This is a real and present danger, the secondary effects of COVID, but how it affects our hospitals and community.
* Physicians and team members are doing an amazing job, but they are getting burned out from overwork. Fatigue is a very real problem and this current wave is taxing our abilities for us to provide services.
* Thought the second wave would come in the Fall and that there was more time to prepare.
* The community needs to realize how compelling and dangerous of an issue this is.
* **This affects not only the people who are seeking treatment for COVID but also those seeking normal medical services for other needs.**
* OLOL has 19-20-year-old healthy kids in the ICU without any comorbidities.
* Also seeing an increase of 50-60-year-olds without comorbidities in the ICU.
* **There is no way to tell who it will affect in a severe way.** Fortunately, it doesn't affect most people, but it is a very real problem.
* Wear your mask. Be smart. Good hygiene. Do not expose yourself to unnecessary risk. Avoid large crowds. Physically distance. It is extremely important right now.

**Gov. John Bel Edwards**

* Testing available in EBR, no symptoms needed, no exposure needed. Please take advantage of the FREE test while testing the available.
   * You can pre-register at DoINeedACovid19Test.com - please do not register multiple times.
   * Thanks to the WH Taskforce for putting surge testing in Louisiana.
* **Working to establish a new surge testing site in the New Orleans area.**
* ***Deliberate misinformation campaign about the state inflating numbers by counting every positive test as a positive case. That is not the case, only your first test is counted. Every individual who tests positive only counts as one case regardless of the number of positive test results they may get.***
* If you have COVID19 in your state you will see cases go up, then hospitalizations, then deaths. It doesn't make sense that you would have hospitalizations and deaths going up without cases having gone up as well.
* We have people being irresponsible and we are asking them to stop. No one should pay attention to what these individuals are saying.
* We are not perfect, but we've put in multiple redundant systems to make sure the data is accurate, timely, and that we are sharing in a manner to be as transparent as possible.
* Encouraged today by the vast majority of businesses and local leaders who are taking this seriously and masking up to protect their loved ones, employees, and the state of Louisiana to make sure we get back on top of the virus as soon as we can.
* Asking everyone to take this virus seriously and do his or her part.
* No one wants to go back to Phase 1. It shouldn't be necessary to go backward, but the only way to keep us from doing that is if everyone wears their mask when they are outside their home. It is a small price to pay. Be a good neighbor. If nothing else has respect for our healthcare workers who are working months on end.
* There is not a safer place than at home. If you go out do so as little as possible. You do not need to go to the grocery store 3 times. Just go one once. If you go do not bring your entire family
* If when you'd o go out you practice social distancing, washing your hands, and do not go out when you are sick. We will turn this around.

*Comment on the weather*

* Watching the tropics. We're in hurricane season.
* TP 8 is moving across the Gulf Coast towards Texas but there is a risk of heavy rainfall in the S, SW, and Central parts of the state.
* Areas south of I-10 could receive between 2-4"" of rain and tides are running higher than normal.
* Flash flooding is a possibility. Do not drive on any street that could be underwater.
* Will monitor Storm Gonzales.
* Go to GetAGamePlan.org and prepare for a hurricane.
* Preparing for a hurricane is different this season because of COVID19. Encourage everyone to check GetAGamePlan.org to get prepared.

# Questions

*What's the plan if we run out of space, is the plan to shift them to Morial?*

First off, we are going to make sure that doesn't happen that we don't run into a situation where we cannot provide healthcare. We still have 250 beds at the Morial Convention Center with staffing for 60 with 28 beds currently being filled. We can expand to 60 more beds quickly. Further, much of the investments we made early on created new permanent surge capacity at various hospitals around the state. So we are in better shape than we were before.

Frankly, **my bigger concern is not about beds, but about staffing.** We believe we will be able to make the adjustments necessary and open the surge units, but the bigger challenge is around staffing. It is bigger this time because the surge we are seeing is happening in multiple parts of the country at one time. Hard to draw upon out-of-state staff because of those areas and not willing to give them up because they need them too. We discussed it with the VP last week after a phone email with hospital staff prior. Submitted a request through FEMA and it is currently pending. Looking to us the existing footprints of our hospitals, because it is easier to solve the staffing challenges than open up a new facility that isn't part of the existing footprint. No plan to currently create new facilities, but are working to fill staffing shortages.

*How much did you request from the FEMA*

As best as I can recall it was 300 Request to FEMA ranged from phlebotomists, ICU nurses, respiratory therapists, and so forth. I will get you the exact information.

*Some people in Acadiana and Lafayette, in particular, feel the local agencies and parish governments are not doing their parts to enforce the mandates. What can we do on the state level to drive home how important it is to follow the mandates*

When you watch Fauci or Birx speak and see what is coming out the CDC, that speak to you about the importance of these mitigations measures and you accompany it with the numbers we are seeing in Louisiana right now, not just cases but hospitalizations and deaths, you would hope the people would be responsible enough, take that into consideration, and they will comply because they understand it is important for those who are valuable, to help the medical community. **Even if for some strange reason that is totally incomprehensible that you don't care about COVID you should care about there being capacity in the hospital if you get into a car accident or a family member has a stroke, you want that care to be available.** We just need people to focus on the task at hand, do their part, be good neighbors. It is not that we won't force these things but if the people of Louisiana are going to make us enforce all of this we will not be successful. There are 4.6 million people in Louisiana, 10s of 1,000s of businesses if the people of Louisiana are going to sit back and say we will make you enforce every part of this we are doomed. As I mentioned the vast majority of businesses and people are being responsible but there are still too many that are not. So I am directing these comments to those individuals. IF you want to be mad at me, and disagree with me be mad and disagree but do so with a mask when you are outside of your house.

*Where do you think the deliberate misinformation campaign is coming from?*

I do not know. I am not personally investigating it. I am doing what I can to make sure no one attaches any credibility to it. This not just happening in Louisiana. This is happening in all of the other states that are having this tremendous resurgence. No one is out there ""cooking the books"". One thing we would do, if it was safe to do, is open our hospitals up so they could see with their own eyes the people who are fighting for their lives. They would know this is not a made-up number. This is grossly negligent and irresponsible. I am asking people not to do it and for others not to believe it.

*Are you surprised that bars are the top location for an outbreak of COVID*

I cannot say I'm surprised, bars were one of the last things opened because we knew the environment is not the easiest to control so people do things safely. It's just the nature of that establishment. Many people go to a bar to stay for several hours, have multiple drinks, and relax their inhibitions. They may have one mindset going in and another coming out. Then there is loud music and so you need to speak louder and release more particles if you happen to have COVID19. Then if you're listening you tend to get closer to hear than you should be. We were hopeful restrictions would work, but for the vast majority of bars, it proved to be too much. **This is not just here in Louisiana. It is a WH Taskforce recommendation for our state and other states with high rates of COVID-19. It is** ***also*** **a worldwide recommendation.** Once South Korea came out of its lockdown they had to shut down every bar in Seoul because they had a similar experience.

*With staffing being an issue is the Morial Convention center a viable option as a field hospital*

**Dr. Henry Kaufman, chief medical officer at Our Lady of Lourdes:**  We have physical space, we have beds that are used during the day for outpatient surges. Those can be converted into hospital rooms. We have beds that are typically used for other purposes, and those have been converted to rooms. However, as we see an increasing number of transferrable cases in the community we see our nurses become infected. **When a nurse becomes infected the quickest they return to work is 10 days.** As a result, there is a huge pool of nurses who are currently out right now. This puts a strain on other nurses and staff in the hospital. So far it is working out, but our nurses are tired. The problem is not needing physical space, it is having enough people in our community to staff those beds to keep our nurses healthy. One way you can prevent yourself from getting COVID is to stay active and healthy, well-rested, and that your immune system is working well. Nurses, physicians, and staff are tired and not taking care of themselves as well as they need. This is a vicious cycle. Everyone is looking for staff right now. We are not at the point of reaching out to non-traditional areas for staffing. We have disucssed calling in retired nurses or those who have moved to other careers who still hold their licenses who could help.

H*ave you thought of reaching out of state for staffing?*

**Dr. Henry Kaufman, chief medical officer at Our Lady of Lourdes:** We have contacted local staffing agencies, not many people available, anyone who is employable is employed. Everyone across the country is seeking nursing right now. Yes, we have considered that.

**Governor John Bel Edwards**

I've had requests to take national guard soldiers in a medical unit and have them available at the hospitals. But guess where the national guard soldiers in our medical unit work? In our hospitals. So I would be pulling them from one hospital to send them to another hospital around the state. The first thing we did was put out an EMAC request to all other states to see if they had anyone they could offer to address what we need. Exactly zero states offered any staffing. So then you start looking at staffing contractors and we are working that angle now. That is proving to be difficult as well, which is why we continue to work with FEMA on staffing.

In regards to the Morial Convention Center, remember that facility is for the less acute patients to allow hospitals to free up space sooner than they would. So once a patient reaches that level of care where they don't need an acute bed, but can't go home, they can go to the Morial Convention Center for care. Having hospitals sending their less severe patients to the convention center is something we are considering.

*With the testing shortage issue in terms of a turnaround..*

I just want to be clear we are doing an extraordinary amount of tests, but it is not a shortage of collection kits. There are reagent issues in the lab that are contributed to longer turnaround times, as well as the sure volume of tests. So of all the tests, we reported today 65% were within the last week. 30% were from the week before. That gives you an idea of the percentage of tests. This greatly impacts our ability to fight COVID-19. If someone waits 7-10 days to find out they are positive and did not curtail their activities, we know they are out there spreading that disease. Plus if it takes too long to get a test result back the contact tracing is too hard. So the turnaround time at the labs is the current challenge, not the testing supplies itself.

*with turnaround times does this challenge testing congregate settings*

In congregate settings, we are testing 100% of residents and staff every 2 weeks. We are seeing some delays in getting those results back. Anytime you see that it interferes with our ability to quickly get on top of the situation and appropriately quarantining patients. It is also true for the staff member who goes home at night and interacts with their family.

Over the next approx 8-12 weeks it is the goal of the Federal Government to send a rapid point of care tests to every nursing home. We are starting to see those machines arrive in small numbers this week and that will continue. That way tests are administered with results being known within 24 hours. It sounds too good to be true, so we need to make sure the machines come and we have all the testing materials that are needed.

*Why are casinos not facing additional restrictions?*

I'm not going to tell you we haven't experienced any issues at casinos but I can say they have been few in number and much more easily removed because you only have only a small number of them operating. Plus it is the most regulated industry in Louisiana so if you go in there and tell them a problem the corrections get made. We know they have been very responsive to any remedial measures we have told them to take. That is why they are open. We believe they can safely operate at the level of occupancy we have described. We want as much of our economy opened as possible consistent with public safety and the health of our people. Where we can operate a business safely we want to do that. Under the limitations, we currently have in place with casinos they can operate safely.

# Closing Remarks

We have flattened the curve before and we can do it once again. We can do it without going back to Phase 1. But everyone must do their part. So if you want the economy open then we must all do our part. Please wear a face covering. Social distance. Stay home when you are sick. Wash your hands often. Watch out for the most valuable. The safest place you can be is at home. Lift one another upon prayer and focus on our blessings. If nothing else let's be thankful for our healthcare workers. Everyone has a healthy and safe weekend. God bless.

Coronaviruslouisiana,wowwww88,Are there any teachers on here?,"I have a child going to kindergarten and, at least where I live, kids that are in third grade and below aren’t required to wear masks. While I do understand this.. (I can’t see my 5 year old wearing a mask for hours), I don’t really get why those lower grades are going everyday of the week while the higher grades are going to do an alternating schedule. 


Wouldn’t it make sense for the younger kids without a mask to go less often? They are the ones that are probably the most prone to spreading germs. Does this have to do with the fact that parents need to work and rely on school for childcare? Also, how are teachers feeling about being around kids without masks? I know even with masks it’s still scary.. but I feel like this isn’t fair for you guys. I guess it’s the only option for now?",4,1595532326,louisianna,2020-07-23 15:25:26

Fitness, bodybuilding, and powerlifting is very important to me. For physical and mental health. I need the gym to maintain that lifestyle, home workouts don’t do the same, and I don’t have the space or money for a home gym. 

Anyways, I was excited to finally be able to get back in the gym. My gym was already very clean and members always wiped down equipment before Covid. 

My gym’s owner did an amazing job rearranging the entire gym to make sure things are spread out. It looks great. He also provided a laughable amount of Santizer and wipes, every empty spot has a bottle of something ready for you. 

The gym was quiet at 7pm, about 7 people total. The problem? Three people with the masks hanging around their necks. I felt perfectly safe except for these three people. Already on day 1, these are the people that will ruin it.

CoronavirusMa,CherryMoMoMo,Worst-case scenarios predicted Mass. hospitals would be overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Here’s why that didn’t happen," [https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/10/nation/worst-case-scenarios-predicted-mass-hospitals-would-be-overwhelmed-by-covid-19-patients-heres-why-that-didnt-happen/](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/10/nation/worst-case-scenarios-predicted-mass-hospitals-would-be-overwhelmed-by-covid-19-patients-heres-why-that-didnt-happen/) 

Our hospitals rule!

&amp;#x200B;

 

On the night of May 1, Dr. Eric W. Dickson, chief executive of UMass Memorial Health Care, went to bed praying for a reprieve.

The Central Massachusetts hospital system, despite adding dozens of ICU beds to handle the expected surge in COVID-19 patients, had reached its limit. It could not take one more patient.

“I don’t get frazzled very often,” said Dickson, an emergency medicine specialist. “I was pretty frazzled the first week of May.”

Still, day after day, UMass Memorial squeaked by. That one-patient-too-many never arrived. Instead, just in time, COVID-19 cases leveled off and then declined.

Every hospital leader had the same nightmare in the run-up to this spring’s COVID-19 surge: that a moment would come when the number of patients would overwhelm hospital resources. All had read about the doctors [in Italy](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/11/nation/italy-begins-grapple-with-how-ease-coronavirus-restrictions/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) who, short on lifesaving equipment, had to choose who would live and who would die.

But it hasn’t happened here.

“We were able to care for everyone who needed us,” said Dr. Paul Biddinger, director of the Center for Disaster Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

In recent interviews, hospital leaders described how they did it — and how this spring’s challenges prepared them for a possible second surge in the fall.

 For starters, hospitals proved nimble in [increasing the number of intensive care patients they could treat](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/18/metro/inside-boston-medical-center-heart-coronavirus-storm/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), swiftly tripling the number of ICU beds statewide. Also, people with ailments other than COVID-19 avoided care in greater numbers than expected, freeing up space and staff.

In addition, hospitals [planned for the worst-case predictions](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/04/metro/dispatch-mgh-emotional-limbo-front-lines-caring-very-sick-with-covid-19/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link). Instead, transmission of the disease was kept in check because residents stayed home as advised, [flattening the proverbial curve](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/20/nation/mass-general-models-show-flattening-curve-covid-19-patients-not-expected-overwhelm-system-during-this-weeks-surge/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).

The predictive models were based on “what would happen if we did not put in shelter-in-place,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “We basically shut the entire Commonwealth down. If we had let things go, we would have 20 to 60 percent of people getting infected.”

UMass Memorial, [hit later](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/15/nation/state-releases-list-current-massachusetts-coronavirus-hospitalizations/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) and harder than the Boston hospitals, was unusual in reaching capacity. Boston Medical Center, caught off-guard early in the surge, had to [transfer nine patients](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/07/metro/coronavirus-cases-surge-citys-safety-net-hospital-four-out-10-cases-are-now-related-pandemic/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) to other hospitals on April 5. But that didn’t happen again.

Boston Medical Center and most other hospitals had room for more COVID-19 patients even on the peak days: April 21, when nearly 4,000 were hospitalized statewide, and April 26 when ICU occupancy reached 1,089.

Of the five [field hospitals](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/18/metro/patients-start-fill-field-hospitals-amid-surge-coronavirus-cases/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) the state built to handle hospital overflow, three did not see a single patient, while the ones in cavernous convention centers in Boston and Worcester did not come close to filling up.

That happened even though Massachusetts had one of the country’s highest rates of coronavirus infections and deaths at the time.

“It taxed our teams significantly, but we did not get to the tipping point,” said Amy Hoey, chief operating officer of Lowell General Hospital.

Based on experiences in Italy, Seattle, and Wuhan, China, the Mass General Brigham hospital group ([formerly known as Partners HealthCare](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/11/27/major-rebranding-partners-heathcare-change-name-mass-general-brigham/Eh5Empu05Y6UhN3wE2WqdJ/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)) expected to see just under 2,000 COVID-19 patients during the surge, said Biddinger, who is the hospital group’s director for emergency preparedness. Instead, they treated 900, about half of them in the ICU, he said.

“That still required almost all of our hospitals to create surge ICU space beyond what they normally had as an ICU,” he said. For example, at the peak, Massachusetts General Hospital had 150 patients on ventilators — three times more than usual.

Dr. Dani Hackner, chief clinical officer of Southcoast Health, described a process of going through the group’s three hospitals bed by bed to assess which could be converted to ICUs. Similarly, the hospital vetted employees’ skills to determine how each could best aid the COVID-19 effort.

Everywhere, critical care nurses were in great demand. But nurses without critical care expertise could still be part of an ICU team, doing such work as turning patients who were attached to ventilators.

Some providers came out of retirement or [flexed their skills](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/20/business/hospitals-redeploy-thousands-health-care-workers-respond-covid-19-crisis/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) to new populations.

“Our head of neonatology was taking care of an 84-year-old patient,” UMass’s Dickson said. “We needed every doctor.”

Given the hospitals’ success at expanding capacity, it may seem that the money spent opening five field hospitals with 1,500 mostly empty beds was wasted. But those involved regarded the extra sites, all now closed, as invaluable.

The two that did see patients provided a crucial relief valve for urban hospitals. And the three that stood empty offered a useful exercise on how to quickly build a spare hospital.

Besides, as Harvard’s Jha put it, “Would you rather have a couple of field hospitals that never opened, or have regular hospitals overwhelmed and people dying in the parking lot? Sometimes you want to overreact and do more than you needed to.”

The Boston Hope field hospital was no makeshift tent. Built at a cost of $12 million in the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, it included 1,000 single rooms with sheetrock walls and electricity; oxygen lines ran to about 200 rooms, and six were equipped for intensive care.

 What’s more, it’s still there, disinfected with all the equipment shrink-wrapped. With no large conventions expected in the near future, Boston Hope stands ready to “break glass and open up again” in the next calamity, said retired Brigadier General Jack Hammond, who oversaw the hospital’s creation and operation.

Boston Hope saw its first patient on April 10 and over the next seven and a half weeks treated around 720 patients, taking in people who would otherwise have occupied acute-care beds needed for sicker patients. They included homeless people who could not be sent back to the streets or shelters where they would infect others, and people recovering from COVID-19 but not needing hospital-level care.

The 200-bed [field hospital at the DCU Center](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/08/metro/pop-up-hospitals-massachusetts-set-open-this-week-handle-influx-coronavirus-patients/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) in Worcester provided a similar service. It saw 275 patients in total, and Dickson called it “absolutely critical” in managing patient flow.

“If we didn’t have that, hospitals would have really had issues discharging people who weren’t well enough to go home,” Dickson said.

The other field hospitals, in Dartmouth, Lowell, and Bourne, closed down without seeing a single patient.

“It actually felt good that we didn’t have to use it,” said Hackner, of Southcoast, which operated the field hospital at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. “The important thing about the field hospital is learning how to do it and do it well. … If we need to do it again we’ll do it faster and we’ll do it even better.”

Hoey, of Lowell General Hospital, appreciated just knowing the field hospital was there, inside a UMass Lowell gym. When it was dismantled, the materials were packaged carefully and stored. “We could bring it back online quickly if needed,” Hoey said.

All hospitals canceled elective surgeries to accommodate COVID-19 cases, but [patient census dropped](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/18/nation/major-boston-hospital-finds-dramatic-drop-stroke-heart-attack-cancer-patients-during-coronavirus-pandemic/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) even lower than expected. [Mysteriously](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/23/nation/strokes-heart-attacks-dont-take-vacation-so-why-have-emergency-department-visits-sharply-declined/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), hospitals even saw fewer heart attacks and strokes — raising fears that patients were shrugging off serious symptoms. And with people staying home, serious accidents virtually stopped.

Lowell General Hospital typically sees four to five cases a week of injuries from severe motor vehicle crashes, gunshot wounds, falls from heights, and the like. During the pandemic surge, Hoey said, the hospital went 54 days without seeing even one severe trauma case.

But if COVID-19 surges again, as is widely expected, hospital leaders hope to take a more nuanced approach to nonemergency services. Shutting down completely had consequences for people’s health, and for [hospital finances](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/11/business/hospitals-coronavirus-crisis-extends-deep-into-their-finances/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).

“If we have a second lockdown,” said Dr. Alastair Bell, chief operating officer at Boston Medical Center, “we don’t want to be in the position of just stopping care again. … I think we’ve learned a lot about how to manage COVID and non-COVID cases at the same time.‘‘

In contemplating the future, hospital officials expect personal protective equipment to remain a worry, especially as hospitals in new hot spots elsewhere [report severe shortages](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/08/ppe-shortage-masks-gloves-gowns/).

Otherwise, hospital leaders say their experiences last spring prepared them well for the expected second wave as people start congregating indoors during the fall, potentially triggering a surge in COVID-19 cases that could coincide with the annual flu epidemic.

Doctors have a better understanding of [how to treat the disease](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/10/metro/improvisation-medical-mysteries-covid-19-icu/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), potentially reducing the length of hospital stays. And the state is better equipped to monitor for a rise in cases, allowing hospitals time to prepare.

Jha says it’s best to think of COVID-19 in terms of tides rather than waves.

“We have much more time to plan, and we’ll see it coming,” he said. “We were so blind all of January, February, and early March. There was [no testing capacity](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/12/nation/severe-shortage-tests-blunts-coronavirus-response-boston-doctors-say/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) and all of a sudden we found ourselves in neck-deep water. ... Now, we’ll see the water level rising.”",1,1594568131,massachusetts,2020-07-12 11:35:31
CoronavirusMa,RIPDODGERSBANDWAGON,What should I expect for senior year?,"Hi all. 6 weeks from Wednesday (August 26) I begin my senior year. I’ve heard that they’re trying to get everyone in school on that day, and we have like 1300 kids in our school. Our options are fully in school, hybrid, or remote, and as of right now remote seems unlikely. They’re also letting families decide to keep their kids home all year if they choose, which will probably narrow down that 1300 to like 1150-1200, I’m not sure. They also have thought about making baseball be in the fall and football in the spring due to the fact that baseball doesn’t have as many fans come and it’s held earlier in the day so EEE might not be a factor.

I was thinking we’d be back in full but with restrictions, but then the national debate began about schools, and most teachers seem largely against it (in many areas I can see why). I know that Massachusetts isn’t really a part of this debate as we never had a second wave, but still it’s really overwhelming to see all these people saying that school shouldn’t be held this fall (and in some cases, the whole year) because it is my senior year, and I don’t mean to be selfish but I really, really wanna be in school and right now it seems like we and our neighbors are the only people in this country who can do it.

Right now I’m scared that my class will suffer a similar or worse fate to this year’s class. Not having graduation next year (and everything before it) isn’t out of the question.",1,1594584701,massachusetts,2020-07-12 16:11:41

I am just curious for anyones advice if I should go or stay. I know that there is no quarantine right now in Nevada so I should be good to hit the strip. Bars there have closed again but a lot of activities are remaining open including the casinos and shopping areas. I know now isn't an ideal time to travel period, but half of me thinks everything will be fine if I wear a mask and the other half is actually anxious about traveling.

CoronavirusMa,TMac1088,What can I do if there is rampant disregard for COVD-19 protective measures at my gym?,"Hi,

Fitness is really important to me, not just for physical health, but for my mental health as well which has been suffering during the pandemic, like it has been for many. I understand that going to the gym poses a risk for infection no matter what, even if Coronavirus safety protocol is followed to the letter. People are disgusting, just how it is.

I'm on the South Shore. I have been to the gym nearly every day since re-opening last Monday. They are checking temps at the door, everyone gets their own sanitizer bottle, stay 6ft+ apart. Good stuff. However, they have the rule ""masks required when not actively lifting"". I'm not sure if that's even following state-mandated protocol to begin with, I would think it's required at all times (I wear mine the whole time, that's for sure)...ESPECIALLY when exerting yourself. People are being far too liberal with it, either only having their mask on when entering/exiting (what good does that do), and I have seen a number of people who seem to just not have a mask with them at all. Additionally, I regularly see people not being thorough in cleaning their equipment when done with it, or they just skip it, the greasy fuckers.

It's absolutely maddening. Given what is happening in the rest of the country, I was surprised that phase 3 moved forward last week. We are VERY LUCKY to be back in the gym...and yet this stupidity, laziness, and reckless disregard for COVID protocol will get these places shut again if people don't fucking take it seriously.

This is a one-location gym, not a chain. The owners/managers see it and say nothing, at least that I can tell. The front desk staff isn't out there enforcing it. And I watch, and I watch, and I watch. I had to move during the pandemic, and so this gym is new for me. I feel like saying something to mgmt would do nothing, other than ostracize me from my new gym. I certainly don't want them to close again. I just want this shit to be enforced and take as seriously as it needs to be. It's our responsibility to all do our part -- and frankly, it is not all that difficult, inconvenient, or restrictive to work out with a mask on. Matter of fact, it's actually quite easy.

Any ideas on how I can get this addressed? Suggestions welcome.

Thanks, and take care.",1,1594641682,massachusetts,2020-07-13 08:01:22
CoronavirusMa,Aromatic_Gap,Thoughts on schools re-opening?,"What are everyone's opinions on schools re-opening?, Just wondering from social standpoint and development needs standpoint?... 

I personally support schools re-opening with strict limitations on students in classroom/schools. Alternate weeks  for number of students taking online class and in-class sessions. Strictly no physcial education and extracricular activities. I feel like schools decrease racism, because students interact with students of all races. Which allows all the students to appreciate the people around them. If we keep students at home for a year and have them interact with students online. We will certainly see some developemental effects and maybe even a spike in racism once schools let say open up a year later.",1,1594648685,massachusetts,2020-07-13 09:58:05

A woman showed up without a mask and was denied entry. My girlfriend said she heard her start screaming that she ""was sick, had a fever, and needs money,"" while refusing to leave holding her foot in the door.

Another representative then inexplicably walked over to the door, pushed it open and waved her in to be helped. They gave the customer a mask which she apparently did not wear right.

&gt; Hundreds of Massachusetts businesses since May have been subject to formal complaints from workers [...] including [... at least 120 ...] cases by allegedly forcing employees with symptoms to work  [...] 
&gt; 
&gt; The complaints were submitted through a special form that Healey made available online to report unsafe workplace conditions related to Covid-19.  [...] 
&gt; 
&gt; Several businesses have been the subject of six or more complaints, most of them retail chains such as Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT), Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) and Ocean State Job Lot.
&gt; 
&gt; Workers have pointed the attorney general’s office to a range of alleged violations, including a failure to allow for enough social distancing and a lack of cleaning and disinfection.  [...] 
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the serious nature of the claims, the attorney general’s office in many cases does not have the direct legal authority to prosecute health and safety issues. Enforcement is divided  [...]  between the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), the Massachusetts Department of Labor Standards, and local boards of health.
&gt; 
&gt; [... (the article goes into descriptions of agency follow-ups that do not involve fines or stronger actions, but rely on health education and informing companies of their legal responsibilities.) ...]
&gt; 
&gt;  [...]  no industry in Massachusetts has received more complaints than retail and consumer-facing businesses [...] 
&gt; 
&gt; After retail, the industries that have received the most complaints are restaurants and hotels, followed by hospitals and other health care facilities. 
&gt;  
&gt;  [...]

*Families, in consultation with their medical providers, will ultimately make the decision as to
whether their children will attend in-person instruction, or whether their children will continue
with remote learning. Districts should engage regularly and substantively with families in their
primary language to ensure that they have accurate and up-to-date information to make informed
decisions about whether an in-person return is best for their children. This also means that all
districts will need to have a remote learning program in place for students who are unable to
return to in-person school.*

This seems to indicate to me that parents will have a choice to stay with remote learning. But can the district override this? My children attend two different school districts and I haven't heard from either one what the plan is for the fall.",10,1595190618,massachusetts,2020-07-19 16:30:18

CoronavirusMa,eaglessoar,"A note on other data sources e.g. rt.live, Worldometer, Johns Hopkins etc","I want to dispel some confusion that is out there with other data sources. I believe it was a CDC requirement to start also reporting probable cases separately and in addition to confirmed cases. Now what is a probable case? There are 3 definitions in the MA.gov report:

1. Patients with a positive serology/antibody test and either COVID-like symptoms or likely exposure to COVID-19 are counted as probable cases.  
&gt; so these people had a positive antibody test (not a molecular/active test) and either showed symptoms or were likely exposed, by definition probable cases

2. Patients who did not have a laboratory test but whose death certificate listed COVID-19 as a cause of death are counted as probable deaths.  
&gt; these people would never show up in an antibody test or active test but had symptoms at the time of death, 219 deaths have been filed this way

3. Patients who did not have a laboratory test but had COVID-like symptoms and were likely exposed to COVID-19 are counted as probable cases
&gt; these people will also never show up on a test, their inclusion in positive figures does not also come with an increase in testing numbers

Because there are multiple ways for a probable case to be reported with out any actual test happening I do not believe it makes sense to include probable cases when talking about positive rates.

I truly believe probable cases are no longer active cases. If we had infinite testing and compliance we would've found them months ago but we're just finding them now for whatever reason. For this reason it doesn't make sense to include probable cases when talking about growth rates: people testing positive probable will no longer be spreading the virus.

Now let's look at a few of these sites and why I think you truly ought to be following just the MA.gov numbers or statistics derived from them with an understanding of the nuance behind the numbers like I or /u/oldgrimalkin provide daily and to be honest this is why I do this daily because there is a lot of nuance here and it helps to understand and answer people's questions.

So here we have [Johns Hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/massachusetts), probably one of the most reliable sources for aggregation. I don't have so much an issue with how they are presenting data as they appear to be consistent but there may be issues with how others consume that data. Yesterday they reported a positive rate of 2.3% with 255 new positive cases...but wait I only reported 1.6% what gives. To get to 2.3% Johns Hopkins added our 81 probable cases to the numerator (cases) and then ... they just added 81 to the denominator as well (tests) but I hope if you've read all of this you realize: more than 81 anti body tests were done yesterday and probable results can come from people who never take a test. So now we have one of our most reliable sources overstating the positive rate in MA yesterday. If you take this data at face value and go use it elsewhere...

...like on [rt.live](https://rt.live/us/MA) you might over state growth rates. Here on rt.live we can see the same 255 figure for positive results yesterday with the same incorrectly inflated denominator. Now we have a derivative value based off of this faulty data which is the growth rate rt which then gets reported in papers and other outlets, based on incorrect data.

Finally, we have sites like [worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/massachusetts/) which I am unsure how they get their data in fact I am almost certain they are not using actual data but modeling combined with data as MA only updates active cases once per week yet they have our active cases growing and currently at 9966. They honestly might be using rt.live growth rates to project active cases. If you look at the report from the state from last Wednesday [here](https://www.mass.gov/doc/weekly-covid-19-public-health-report-july-15-2020/download) (we'll get an update tomorrow) you can see the state claims we have 2586 active cases. So where does worldometer get 9966 and where are they getting data to update these charts daily?

A final note on MA.gov's record of active cases. They define a case as no longer active if:  

&gt; NOTE: Individuals who had a confirmed case of COVID-19 and are no longer in isolation are considered for purposes of this report to be recovered. As part of this definition, DPH is counting people as released from isolation after 21 days of illness or 21 days past the date of their test in all settings including nursing homes and state facilities.

So active cases are those which have had a positive test in the last 21 days (and are still alive), this may slightly understate some cases which take a very long time to heal but I doubt that there are 7k active cases from people &gt; 21 days since their last positive test but only 2.5k active cases from positive tests in the last 21 days. So again what gives worldometer?

Let me know if you have any further questions.",44,1595339308,massachusetts,2020-07-21 09:48:28

We are leaning toward a late August or September start to see how things go over the next month. If MA numbers notably jump at any time, we definitely plan to pull the child back home.

I should add that we’re fortunate that our center seems to be doing everything they can reasonably do to keep everyone safe given the ages. Masks won’t be required for kids, and that seems like the right call to me because there’s no way a 2-5 year old can keep them on all day without touching it and risking contamination. It does make me nervous though.

CoronavirusMa,hexgirll,DESE schools plans for Fall 2020?,"I know most districts are trying to still figure everything out, but I was wondering what the guidelines in MA are for K-12 schools in the fall. Side question, based on data what seems like the more feasible option too? 

For reference where my younger sibling goes to public school they are proposing three scheduling options:

1) Each student is assigned to a group and the said group reports to school either M/W or T/Th, and alternating Fridays between the two.

2) Each student is assigned to a group and school is in sessions, ie a morning session and an afternoon session. School is attended M-F, but hours are adjusted.

3) Fully virtual, which seems like everyones last option despite it being probably the better option for everyone's health imo. 

I know there is a lot of issues and debate right now with how .01% of students would potentially die if they go in person, and issues with teachers unions and time off, but I am just trying to envision what the fall would likely entail. Teachers-- please feel free to respond with how you feel about it as well!

I know many districts are still in the processes of deciding, but I was wondering what the guidelines are set by the DESE, or if they are just following the guidelines set by the state for all other public places. Also huge thank you to our teachers who are navigating a difficult time in their profession. Although nothing is ""normal"" whatever decision is made, I hope it is the best for you and your students and families. 

Stay healthy and thank you for your replies!",3,1595638960,massachusetts,2020-07-24 21:02:40

I'm a little late to come back to work, but I took an extra long leave due to COVID fears. I just went back to work starting last weekend, and it was much worse than I would have expected. My coworkers wear masks when around customers, which is good, but when they're back in the salon all the masks come off. We're always within 6ft of each other because the room is tiny and the grooming equipment cramps is together, and there's always 3-5 people scheduled at a time. It's impossible to stay away from each other. I don't know what to do to keep myself safe from them. One of them literally already got diagnosed with COVID last month and stayed in the hospital for a week, and she still doesn't wear a mask. I want to say something to my employer, or report the store for breaking COVID guidelines or something, but I'm concerned about my job security and my relationship to my coworkers. What should I do?

CoronavirusMa,Orly_yarly_ouirly,I feel like I’m being gaslit - why is everyone freaking out about the rise in cases when it’s very obvious to me that the rise is due to the new testing initiative?,"As I’ve already spoken about in other threads... on July 10th, we started a new testing initiative that is providing free tests to anyone who wants one (even asymptomatic) until August 14th. Test centers are in hot spot towns, but anyone from anywhere in the state can get tested at one of the centers.

Since July 10th, we’ve seen a rise in testing from ~10k to about ~14k per day. We’ve also seen a rise in cases from the mid 100’s to 273 today. 

To me, this rise in cases is obviously connected to the new testing initiative. We are testing people who have never been qualified to tested before (asymptomatic). This whole time, we’ve heard that there are many more cases out there than we’ve known about. Now, we are exposing what’s always been there - at least, that’s how I’m interpreting it. 

Yet, there are tons of people here and on r/Boston who are fearful that this is the beginning of another surge, like we’ve seen happening in the south. Why do people think this? Am I wrong? Are they? 

I feel confident that this is nothing to worry about, yet I’m concerned that the popular public opinion of fear that this a surge is going to result in backtracking our reopening phases.",1,1595812808,massachusetts,2020-07-26 21:20:08
CoronavirusMa,AbjectEvening9,Question - Indoor office occupancy for Essential Business,"Hi I'm looking to see if someone can help me figure out what the recommendations are around indoor office spaces in Phase 3.

I work for a company that is an essential business. We have locations throughout the state that service the public with about 10 employees per location. We have a office where we handle business operations with about 200 people (non customer facing). However we have had a skeleton crew in the  backoffice building for essential in-person operations and all other employees are either working remotely or temporarily furloughed. 

Our CEO has always hated remote work, and is 'fed up' with this remote work scenario because a few employees abused it (because we have never, in the history of the company, allowed remote work and not everyone is a stellar employee). He is forcing all employees to come back into the building, all 200 of us. Despite the business actually doing quite well from a financial standpoint despite everything going on. 

Is this even allowed to have all of these people shoved into a shared office building? We technically meet the minimum of 'social distancing', but barely. The letter of the guidance but not the spirit. Or are we exempt because we are essential? I know some of my peers companies are rotating staff in offices with 40-50% capacity and mixed schedules to keep some semblance of normalcy while  attempting to mitigate risk to their staff (or you know... killing them).

I'm very much considering trying to find another job over this poor, shortsighted decision. The airflow in the building is very poor, and there's a history of people sharing illness readily in the building in normal circumstances. A lot of shared, high touch surfaces, few bathrooms, etc. My anxiety is through the roof over this.",1,1595813181,massachusetts,2020-07-26 21:26:21

CoronavirusMa,hwillis,Reminder: The mortality rate of COVID-19 is not .01%. It's much higher.,"[149,849 people in the US have died from COVID-19](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) so far.  With a population of 331,146,570, even if every single person had been infected already the mortality rate would be **.045%**.  Think about how many states haven't taken off yet, how few people you think are tested.  Literally *whatever* you think, however you think the numbers are fudged, the mortality rate is cannot possibly be less than 1/1000 if that number of deaths is anywhere near true.

The death rate in Mass is much higher.  Among people who tested positive, it's 8%.  With 8,529 deaths and a population of 6,893,000, if everyone in MA had already gotten it, the death rate would be .124%.  Normally in MA, ~160 people die per day.  We had many days where more than that died of COVID-19.  You can't make up that many dead bodies.  Even if a *million* people Massachusetts had gotten it -ie ~9% of people with it actually got tested- then the mortality rate is just under 1%.  You know more that 100 people in Massachusetts- if we all get this, people you know will die.  If that doesn't scare you, the impact on the economy when managers die at *every company* will be massive.  

And obviously, Massachusetts is not the most heavily infected.  Of ~19,450,000 people in NY, 32,689 have died from COVID-19.  That's a death rate of .168%.  Deaths per positive test is 7.4%.  Only 2.26% of the state has tested positive.

In NYC (population ~8,399,000), 18,862 people died after a confirmed positive COVID-19 test- .225%.  If you include the probable deaths that number goes to 23,485, for a rate of .28%.  2.6% of the city has tested positive, and 8.56% of them have died (confirmed) or as high as 10.7% (probable).  Even if *every single person in NYC has had COVID-19 already*, .67% of them had to be hospitalized.  

Either this is so infectious that everyone in NYC has had it (not the case) and *still* 1/150 need to be hospitalized, or it's less infectious but the hospitalization rate is higher.  Maybe only 20% of people have had it already, and they missed 87.5% of them- that means that 1/30 people still gets hospitalized.  That's unlikely- antibody tests in the general population of NYC is 20%, so that means that everyone who never suspected they had gotten COVID-19 would need to have actually gotten it at the same rate as people who did.  Do you want to take a &gt;1/30 chance of breathing through a tube for a couple weeks?

NYC as a whole didn't even get as hit as hard as the hotspots.  Of the 2,273,000 people in Queens, 7,165 died- .32%.  There have been 68,821 positive tests- 10.4% of them have died.  There have been 660,788 total tests- a 10.4% positive rate.  Say that 10.4% rate generalizes to the whole population, so that if you tested all 2,273,000 people in Queens you'd get 236,733 positive results for people who had (or had had) it.  **That's a death rate of 3%**, and [it applies to people age 18-44](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-boroughs.page).  People in that age range are at the same as the overall average, while people over it are 20-30% more at risk.  And again, the 10.4% infection rate probably *doesn't* generalize- it's probably lower, since people who get are infected are more likely to get tested.  **In the Bronx, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was probably above 3%.**

If a 3% mortality rate is right, you can guess how many people in MA have had COVID-19 based on the number of deaths.  This isn't scientifically rigorous in any way- the above has steadily gotten less rigorous, but it's all basically valid- applying Queens' death rate to other places is less so.  It's not crazy, because the population in queens (even though it skews poorer and Black American, and whatever other risk factors) is not really that different from the rest of the US.  Poor Black Americans may die at a 30% higher rate, but the error bars on this are way above 30%.  Queens still has some of the best medical care in the US.  People there were still more likely than most to take COVID-19 seriously.  People may have tested negative simply because they were tested after they had recovered, but even with 20% instead of 10% that's still just 50% error.

I'll do numbers with 3%, and then in parenthesis the numbers for 1%.  With 8,529 deaths, that would be 284,300 (852,900) cases, or a 4.1% (12.4%) chance that you personally have had COVID-19.  How many people do you know who have had COVID-19?  The average person knows very roughly 150 people.  Maybe you know 50 people well enough that you would have heard if they had been infected.  Do you know 2 (6) people who have had it?  Or 6 (18)?  If you're like me, those numbers sound high.  If you think fewer than 6 (18%) of your close friends and family have had it, then that should tell you the death rate is above 3% (1%).

Then there are the long term effects.  I can personally vouch for the lung scarring, and the 4+ months of fatigue.  It has been a *slow* recovery for my lungs.  I've never had an inhaler before, and I had to learn breathing exercises that are only demonstrated by 80 year old ladies, because that's the only people who normally need to do them.  I'm only now starting to feel normal, and I got this at the end of March.  God only knows what my heart and lungs will be like when I'm older.  I'm in a good place regarding how I feel about my health and future, but to be blunt the thought of getting it *again* is terrifying.  

You want to go outside?  Sure, outside's alright.  Hell, our rate is low enough that maybe 1/500 people (1/3000 people test positive and infectious every 2 weeks) can infect you right now.  If you are exposed to 10 people per day, you might go two months before even being exposed to it, or longer if they're the same people.  Whatever you do, **protect yourself**.  Wear the damn masks, wash your hands, don't travel to hotspots.  Do safer things than getting this virus, like street racing, or diving with your eyes closed, or competitive brick eating.",1,1595839065,massachusetts,2020-07-27 04:37:45

CoronavirusMa,eaglessoar,On yesterday's positive rate and following trends in general,"Trends are great to follow when the underlying sourcing of the data is consistent, if you have the same methodology for sourcing tests day in and day out you can reliably form trends from this. However when you change the testing methodology e.g. by opening a burst of free testing in hard hit areas, you can no longer compare to previous trends

So what happened, what changed with our testing?  

&gt; Baker announced Wednesday (7/8) the launch of new sites in eight communities that have higher positive COVID-19 rates and lower testing levels than the state average. Those cities are Chelsea, Everett, Fall River, Lawrence, Lowell, Lynn, Marlborough and New Bedford.

So now we'd expect more results to be coming from these communities than previously. 

We can look at 7/22 data to see what the recent rates within these towns was:

Chelsea: 3.54%  
Everett: 2.22%  
Fall River: 5.28%  
Lawrence: 3.71%  
Lowell: 2.17%  
Lynn: 3.62%  
Marlborough: 1.92%  
New Bedford: 2.69%  

So for simplicity lets say the average across these locations is 3%. So now we have a combination of 2 sample: the normal baseline testing going on and the increased testing in these locations which we imagine have 3% positive rates

If these sites made up 1/3 of the testing and the baseline population is 1.5% then we have: 2/3 x 1.5% + 1/3 x 3% = 2%

This is just a simple example of how a small increase in testing in a focused area can bring the rates up for the whole state. If we had the granular data about the increase in testing here we could back out what the baseline rate is but unfortunately we dont have that data.",1,1595857936,massachusetts,2020-07-27 09:52:16

CoronavirusMa,Shufflebuzz,How are colleges going to accommodate students during their 2-week self quarantine?,"The [Travel Order](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-travel-order) goes into effect Aug 1st. Students arriving from outside of NE, NY, NJ and HI have to self quarantine for 2 weeks.  



The [self-quarantine requirements](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-travel-order#how-to-quarantine-) are no joke.   

Here they are:  


1. Travelers, along with their travel party, must separate from all other people for 14 days.  
1. Travelers must not be in public or otherwise leave the identified quarters.  
1. The living quarters must have a separate bathroom facility for each individual or family group. Access to a sink with soap, water, and paper towels is necessary.  Cleaning supplies (e.g. household cleaning wipes, bleach) must be available in the bathroom.  
1. Travelers must have a way to self-quarantine from other household members if a fever or other symptoms develop, in a separate room(s) with a door.  
1. During the quarantine period, no one else should be in the living quarters other than those in the Travel Party, including hotel staff or delivery persons, as applicable.  
1. Food must be delivered to the living quarters.  
1. Travelers must have a sufficient supply of face masks or face coverings to wear and must be compliant with the Massachusetts’ masking order https://www.mass.gov/doc/may-1-2020-masks-and-face-coverings/download.  
1. Travelers are not to leave their living quarters except to receive urgent medical care.  
1. Travelers should engage in proper hygiene including washing hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds.  If soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used.  
1. Travelers should remain aware of potential COVID like symptoms including: fever (temperature over 100.0 degrees); cough; difficulty breathing; shortness of breath; chills; muscle or body aches; runny nose or nasal congestion; new loss of taste or smell; headache; nausea; vomiting or diarrhea. Travelers with any of these symptoms should immediately contact a healthcare provider.  
1. If no one in the Travel Party develops symptoms, then the travel party may continue with their normal activities after 14 days.  

My takeaways:   
You can't quarantine with a roommate, unless they were in your travel party.   
No shared bathrooms.  
Food must be delivered.  
You can't leave your room except for urgent medical care.

Will asymptomatic people stay home for 10 days, with no pay because they might have been exposed? This is how covid will spread.

I did not have any symptoms or indication of infection, but just wanted to get tested to help add to the stats.  Here's my experience:

 - Arrived at the waiting location (Whitcomb School) at 8:03 AM
 - Followed signs around the school to a point roughly 210 degrees around the school from where I started.
 - Queued behind a long line of cars, which moved forward every 15-20 minutes about ten car lengths.
 - Saw ""Valet Parl"" personnel (with masks) walking around, answering some questions, and generally checking the line.
 - Around 10:30 AM, finally made it to ""the front"" where they were sorting people into rows of about ten cars in the school's main parking lot.
 - Noted valet personnel were occasionally going down a row of cars, speaking to each driver.
 - Around 11:20 AM, valet personnel went down my row, saying it was next.
 - A short time later, they returned, saying to not eat/drink/smoke anything starting now
 - A short time later, they put a sticker on my car and said to follow the line to the second location (Marlborough Hospital) when it started moving
 - A short time later, our row drove to the hospital, where we were directed into a small (&lt;20 cars) lot.
 - Someone came up to the car with a bag containing instructions, saliva-deposit tube, napkin, and hospital contact info (see https://i.imgur.com/mPMFlDy.png).  Explained the instructions were to fill the tube with 5ml of saliva, and they would return in a while.
 - A short time later, they returned, dropping off a contact form to fill out
 - A short time later, another valet personnel came by, taking a picture of the filled out form
 - A short time later, they returned, saying they'd let me know when to drive up to a station they'd setup to drop off the saliva sample
 - A short time later, they pointed me to go, and I drove and parked in front of the station.
 - The station is a couple of windows connected to the hospital, which I walked up to, was asked to show my ID and confirm my name and DOB.  They printed out a sticker, put it on my sample tube, then had me place the tube inside a plastic bag they collected.
 
That was it.  I left a few minutes before noon, meaning I was there from about 8 to noon, the entire time slot they're open.  Unfortunately, while the staff/personnel were very nice and professional, it seemed to be a very inefficient process.  You'll notice the amount of times I wrote ""A short time later"" - this could be anywhere from 5-15 minutes just waiting in my car to be instructed.  Also, the way that they bunch up groups of cars means they're not progressing others who are ready until an entire group is ready.

The bottleneck seemed to be the small parking lot at the second location (hospital).  The less that needs to be done here the better - I would have people fill out the forms, potentially even provide saliva samples, before driving to the second location.  Also, there would be a lot less downtime if people could indicate that their form/sample was ready, instead of waiting for one of a handful staff to come by and check.

Otherwise, as I mentioned before, everyone was courteous and professional.  Results are said to arrive in 24-48 hours.",1,1596214102,massachusetts,2020-07-31 12:48:22

I hope you don't mind, but we think this study might be of interest to some individuals living in Massachusetts.

We (researchers from the University of the Fraser Valley, BC, Canada) are looking for individuals (19+ years of age) who have had COVID-19 (as indicated by a +ive test) and are of ***any*** fitness level to complete an online survey. The online survey consist of 3 parts: demographic variables, COVID-19 symptoms, and physical activity/fitness levels prior to being infected. The survey takes about 6-8 minutes to complete.

The aim of our study is to learn if physical activity levels have any influence on the number of symptoms, durations and severity of symptoms, as well as any complications associated with having COVID-19.

I have a family member that works in a financial business office setting with under 10 employees that did not close down because they were/are deemed an essential business. They don't have foot traffic, no clients come in, just employees. It's in an office building with community bathrooms outside the office space down the hall. They state everyone is spaced 6 feet apart at desks. My issue is no one in this office has worn a mask since this began up until this day. I've periodically asked and they've been honest about it. They've said they're office employees who aren't required to do so because they can social distance. I've read the guidelines from the mass website and I was hoping to show them a ""see you're supposed to"" but I read one section under the guidance for that type of business and it states all employees must wear face coverings and then I keep reading &amp; it will state that employees must social distance and if they cannot meet guidance then they must wear face coverings. Can anyone clarify this for me? I'd appreciate.

CoronavirusMa,hummingbirds_R_tasty,Guidelines question regarding face coverings in an office setting.," I have a question regarding guidelines.

I have a family member that works in a financial business office setting with under 10 employees that did not close down because they were/are deemed an essential business. They don't have foot traffic, no clients come in, just employees. It's in an office building with community bathrooms outside the office space down the hall. They state everyone is spaced 6 feet apart at desks. My issue is no one in this office has worn a mask since this began up until this day. I've periodically asked and they've been honest about it. They've said they're office employees who aren't required to do so because they can social distance. I've read the guidelines from the mass website and I was hoping to show them a ""see you're supposed to"" but I read one section under the guidance for that type of business and it states all employees must wear face coverings and then I keep reading &amp; it will state that employees must social distance and if they cannot meet guidance then they must wear face coverings. Can anyone clarify this for me? I'd appreciate.

Like most I have family that have life threatening health conditions on great day. I cannot seem to get them to grasp I need them to wear a damn mask. I know it would be awkward after almost 6 months to just now show up wearing a mask to work but damn I don't f-ng care.",1,1596312860,massachusetts,2020-08-01 16:14:20

Please just show up ready to take on whatever we ask you to do. Because we are not sure what the set up of the office is going to be, or if we can logistically make it safe, we ask that if you have any unpaid free time in the next 3 weeks, to plan for this. Figure out how to make this work and get back to doing your job, which again, we aren’t quite sure what that will look like yet. If you don’t spend some of your own time getting ready for your new job, you are really going to look unprofessional to the CEO and shareholders. We can give you a couple details on what we think we will be having you do, but we also reserve the right to change that at any time. Because of this, we also have yet to ask if anyone has any pre-existing health concerns and will be unable to return. We realize some staff won’t be returning, but have no idea who, therefore you also may need to take on more work. Again, please spend some unpaid time putting some ideas together for how you will handle this. So we look forward to you coming back to the office in 3 weeks! See you then!

For what its' worth, it appears Massachusetts may be close to the CDC criteria for ""rebound"", at least in terms of cases, which it defines as 5 consecutive days of increased cases and ""multi-day increases in percent positivity with stable or increasing testing volume."" At least anecdotally, it sounds like Mass. also might not meet the CDC criteria for test result turnaround (phase 3 requires median time from test order to result to be less than 2 days). I know I'd like to see measurable criteria out there, rather than just returning to the anxiety of March of wondering when the state would finally do something.

CoronavirusMichigan,B00ger-Tim3,"Remote Learning Options Should Be Part of ""MI Safe Schools"" instead of ""In-Person Instruction &amp; Learn To Live With It""","""MI Safe Schools"" dropped the ball by not mandating a remote learning option for children in public school whilst in Phase 4:

* Schools shut with very few cases in March 2020, yet by late August 2020 back to school time we are on a trajectory to see 1000 cases a day once again
* 100s of students eating together in a lunch room breathing and eating together, yet restaraunts are mandated to limited capacity statewide
* Students sitting closely in classroom without masks several hours a day, yet movie theatres even with masks are forbidden 
* Gym class at school, yet gyms are shut statewide

Its ludicrious to believe COVID-19 won't be spread by children. 30 five year olds crammed into a kindergarten classroom all breathing the same air for 6+ hours a day, no masks. Not counting the bus, not counting the playground, not counting latchkey. We close down movies, gyms, bars, restaraunts, salons, barbers, people working from home until 2021, thermo cameras on factory workers who get temperature checks, retail workers wearing masks and wiping down registers, yet we cram all the kids intogether without masks and pretend its 2018, close our eyes real hard, and hope everything will be OK.

Parents have gone from social distancing and being safe to trusting at least 58 strangers are doing the right thing. What was all the effort for? Why even shut down if we're going to march children into a breeding ground for COVID? Why did we even shut any of these gym/restaraunt/movie businesses down, then turn around and do everything we shamed businesses for, in public schools? This is tantamount to no different to ""learn to live with it"" or ""herd immunity"". It makes everything we did to stop the spread worthless and pointless, because we're going to intentionally spread this fall. That's why there was so much talk about a 2nd wave this fall, in-person classes were ALWAYS planned, with full knowledge it would cause the 2nd wave.

Go ahead and complain teachers can't do online and in-person. Teachers in-person - the ones who don't retire or quit this year - will be busy spending time exessively wiping everything down. What happens when one teacher gets covid? Whole school shutdown? Just that classroom? Any students and staff that came in contact? What about when a student gets it? A student's parents? Its a domino effect that bounces back and forth - unless it gets covered up. If enough action isn't taken, could parents sue the school if they, or their children, get COVID from school

A lot of this could be mitigated with a remote learning option. Nobody is asking for or expecting some robust remote learning option. But having ANY option for remote learning would be nice, rather than forcing in-person. 

**TL;DR = There's going to be a lot of homeschooling in 2020 simply due to the lack of safety in MI unSafe Schools in Phase 4**",8,1594008279,michigan,2020-07-06 00:04:39
CoronavirusMichigan,geekymidmicouple,Clare County- Mask use was around 40 percent until the holiday weekend then it dropped to around 2 percent.,"My fiance and I live in Clare,  and this weekend we went out to a few yard sales,  wore a mask each time,  kept our distance from people.  We've been doing our part and staying home away from people only going out for essential trips.    

People aren't wearing masks and not social distancing.    Mask use has been about 40 percent around here.  

This past holiday weekend though mask use was at 1 percent.    Everyone that heads to Northwest Michigan from SE Michigan has to come through Clare to get up to Northwest Michigan.    Needless to say I didn't stop for gas at the truck stop on M-115 and US 10.  Drove by it and no mask use and just slammed with people.  Did not want to walk into that petri dish.     M-115 was so packed this past weekend that it took me 30 minutes to turn left out of my neighborhood and head into town.  


Even the small lake in our neighborhood was packed and no one was wearing masks or following social distancing. 

Restaurants in the area were also slammed.  I do have respect for one place.  Little greasy spoon in Farwell was limiting capacity and forcing mask use when not eating.  

I expect the numbers to rise in Clare County especially after this busy weekend.  

For those of you who came up here and wore a mask and followed social distancing,  I have respect for you.

They then proceeded to sit down in the CLEARLY CLOSED dining room. 

Two other customers came in, no masks. The manager told them they need to wear a mask or leave. They acted like this was news to them, even though there are signs everywhere that say this. They were nice enough to give them some disposable masks to wear.

CoronavirusMichigan,MLouie18,My idea: too many businesses violating Covid safety in many ways. We need an organization who cares.,"First off let me say I know MIOSHA and LARA and LEO exist. They aren't doing enough. Here is my comment from another post on this thread with a link to another post with a continuation explanation of what I believe needs to be done and what I want to do to help. Original comment follows:

Man, this thing is just a mess. What we really need is for OSHA to get off their asses and hand down the fines they love to give to everyone for bullshit reasons.

If OSHA handed fines to businesses not enforcing the laws, that would be the end of it. Karen can't freak out in a Whole Foods if they hire someone as a greeter / enforcer to let Karen in, in the first place. BOOM! Not only are jobs created in a tough time but also we lower everyone's risk by being responsible.

Now, I have been complaining to MIOSHA about the school I work at. Only one complaint was acted on and an email was sent saying ""hey we got word you are violating. Are you?""

""No no no, of course not. You aren't coming out to investigate so of course we have been compliant. Employee lies."" Obviously that's not exactly how it is said but nothing ever changes in those instances.

Now with that being known I believe we need an organization that isn't afraid to investigate and actually represent workers and care for their safety. In order for OSHA to show up you have to sign the complaint.

If you don't sign your complaint to OSHA, they won't actually investigate. If you sign, your name is revealed to the employer, despite them telling you it won't. But they actually inspect most of the time if you sign.

So the biggest issue, because all my friends are experiencing the same things and because I'm getting message on here with even more horrible situations, they want to report them but know what I do. That when you complain, you have to reveal your name to get results. Sure OSHA says you can't retaliate against whistleblowers, but they aren't even enforcing the safety they were designed to enforce. Are they enforcing when an employee gets retaliated against? Haha Haha no. I've been fired from a job for complaining and so have many I know.

Now, we NEED an organization that isn't afraid to represent workers correctly and investigate these situations. MIOSHA and LEO are not effective at all.

I want to make that organization. I want to sign your MIOSHA complaint as a representative so they find out my name, not yours. They would actually investigate (because you sought some other representation) and also your name wouldn't appear on the complaint.

Now I realize this is a lot of work but it needs to happen. I don't know the legalities of representing someone in an safety concern but looking at some things it looks like anyone can claim to represent anyone for fear of safety. So I don't know if I need to take the steps to become a nonprofit but I'm serious.

Go look at my post in r/michiganunsafebiz I want to investigate these places. I want to help people who don't feel safe. Because I myself don't feel safe at work and have had enough. Im angry, I'm at my wits end. We are human beings, not a statistic to become sick or dead because of greed. Please read my other post i just mentioned and if anyone is interested, wants to help, has abusiness that needs investigation, anything. Let me know. I'll probably make a post with all of this on other Michigan subs as well (providing it is allowed).

TL:DR: I want to form an organization to investigate all of these OSHA violations in which MIOSHA refuses to handle. Too many places are violating basic workers rights. Maybe even a youtube series to expose them so people know to avoid them until they act right. But I need help. I'm one person against a mountain of corruption.",1,1594320605,michigan,2020-07-09 14:50:05

CoronavirusMichigan,b1023,Michigan COVID goal?,"This is kind of an odd question, but what is our goal exactly in Michigan with COVID. It seems like a dumb question but I haven’t heard a clear answer from the media or press conferences. Are we trying to flatten curve (control hospital capacity)? Or are we trying to stop spread completely? I just feel like we should be focusing on watching our hospital capacity and deaths more so than cases because ultimately that is where the danger is. 

Also, if our mentality is to try and eliminate cases then there would be no sports, schools, restaurants or really anything. Let’s be honest it’s impossible to control spread of COVID in school and sports teams. College sports are trying to get a season but shutdown every time there is one case on the team, I mean what do you expect? Cases spread quickly so why are we even trying to open when we know it will result in more cases? After the 2 weeks quarantine for a team, then there will be another case with another 2 weeks and so on.

I don’t know that was like half question and half rant, but I would like to see a “goal”. And if that goal is to try to eliminate cases while trying to stay open, I don’t think we can beat Mother Nature.",1,1594439296,michigan,2020-07-10 23:48:16

Even if social pressure doesn't change behavior, at least those of us who would like to avoid high-risk places can have a bit of a head's up.  It may not be a bad idea to start something up in your area if your neck of the woods is anything like mine and many have just given up on doing anything.

-The post should be a link post, not a screenshot. This way we can avoid ""where do you see this data? Questions that show up routinely

Anyways, I've had a sore throat for a month now. It doesn't really hurt when I swallow,  it's more like the muscle surrounding it is sore. I got tested for COVID and it came back negative. So of course I did the one thing you should never do... google. Well, now I think I have throat cancer. Until I came across a cancer chat board with people sharing the same issue- persistent sore throats for weeks- and all the posts were from March 2020 till now. Doctors all prescribed antibotics and none of them worked. Some went to an ear, nose, throat doctor and came back clear. Others were ""diagnosed"" with acid reflux but said they didn't have reflux issues. I went to comment but the thread was from the UK and wasn't allowing anyone out of the UK to comment. So now Im turning to you reddit.

We have a mask requirement and have to answer all the normal questions and take our temps before going in. They are doing this because we have automotive equipment and they didn't like that we were taking it home to do work. Those who don't have equipment are still working from home.

A coworker the other day told us a friend of his tested positive for Covid recently and that he (co worker) had come into contact with his friend about a month ago (maybe less but I dont know the exact time table). Word started spreading and now he is stuck at home now waiting on the results of the test while we are in the office still.

Am I wrong to think that we should all be at home again? We all feel fine but if this guy was in here with covid then we should all be in quarantine until the test results return and he tests negative.

I just feel uneasy that my employer cares more about their equipment than they care about employees. We worked from home just fine all April and May and then once the stay at home order eased off they made us come in with restrictions.

Those who are positive are being held in quarantine for 14 days with anyone they had direct contact with.

To me, this is crazy. My SO said he and many others in his unit agree, but there's not much they can do about it. His particular unit is not doing anything so essential that it's worth risking lives. Can the national guard be reported to the health department? Or is it above that? Am I overreacting? These guys have been travelling all around Michigan and going to the beach almost everyday. The number of people they are putting at risk is insane. Whoever calls the shots and is making them report is being forced to retire this year because he was caught having affairs with other soldiers, so I'm not sure he would even be punished in any way.",10,1595528364,michigan,2020-07-23 14:19:24

CoronavirusMichigan,MagickOrchid,Party Buses - yea or nay?,"Journey Tours aka [mobilefinewinetasting.com](https://mobilefinewinetasting.com) has started up its summer party bus tours again. This means Friday, Saturday, Sunday tours of busloads of happy, maskless drunks galavanting all over Detroit and Wayne County.

I emailed them about their COVID-19 procedures and while they replied back with information about how the buses are cleaned, they didn't address any issues regarding masks, the no. of people on the tours/social distancing measures, if the windows would be open/ventilation precautions, driver protections, etc.

I don't want to be a spoil-sport and/or devalue local businesses, and while I'm not personally a fan of party buses, this business is well-loved by many, and a community asset.

Party buses/tours have the legal loophole of not being an actual ""bar"", but they are a mostly enclosed space (though sometimes they do open windows), where people are likely maskless (because drinking). This could be a recipe for disaster...for the community, the patrons and the bus drivers.

I'm sure this isn't the only party bus/tour in Michigan having at it right now, but it's the only one I've seen right now in my neighborhood - which happens to have been the second hardest hit zip code in the state. 

After living through what COVID19 did to my neighborhood and the city of Detroit this Spring, I'm a little freaked out...It still feels a little too early. We're still at medium-high risk. Could this count as an ""Unsafe Biz"" report? Or am I being a Corona Karen?

How do you guys feel about party buses and party tours ramping back up?

CoronavirusMichigan,sadfalloutgirl,Working in a Detroit School During Coronavirus?,"Hey Reddit! I'd really appreciate your advice.

My partner is an early childhood paraprofessional and has worked in 1st grade classrooms. Recently, a public school in Detroit offered my partner a paraprofessional job with young children, but the school will be opening for ""in-person"" instruction in the fall. Because of COVID-19, my partner isn't sure if they should accept this position. My partner is interested in getting a masters in education &amp; getting a teaching certificate, so they're considering rejecting this job offer so that they can attend remote grad school. My partner is also immunocompromised.  

Should my partner accept this job, or should they try to find something remote &amp; then apply to grad school? Would it be safe in terms of COVID-19 to work in a Detroit public school? Thank you for your help!",1,1595733746,michigan,2020-07-25 23:22:26

CoronavirusMichigan,yes_affirmative,Lack of mask enforcement from police and local stores,"So I popped into our local Family Fare yesterday, and at the front they had a mask check person. Dude in front of us was holding a mask and was allowed in, but he never put it on once he was in the store. Meanwhile, I saw several others in the store not wearing masks, even entering past the door check without putting them on.

Mentioned this to one employee, and they said there was unfortunately nothing they could do about it once people were in the store, saying they’ve contacted the police before. Our local police said they wouldn’t do anything about it unless individuals became violent, saying it was the job of the state police to enforce the rules regarding masks. State police claimed they were “too busy” to do anything about it.

Asked the guy at the door to at least make sure people had masks on before entering (getting worried for my own safety at this point), and he claimed there was nothing legally he could do beyond asking people to wear masks and providing them with their handouts. This seems to go against the entire notion of the executive order, which absolutely gives businesses the right to refuse service to people without masks, unless I’m missing something? My assumption is management is telling their employees to do the bare minimum to feign compliance but still just let anyone in regardless...not sure if it’s from the store manager or corporate, but still. The business seems to care more about the bottom line than the safety of its employees, customers, and the community, and employees who are concerned have no support from public safety or management unless mask-refusers commit assault.

So...what the fuck?",1,1595770984,michigan,2020-07-26 09:43:04

3 nurses got sick and had to quarantine, the hurting home made them use their sick days THEN their PTO then “pay” for more PTO (the home has an exchange rate if people want extra PTO).



So my mother is telling me that there is a nurse who got sick, confirmed diagnosis, quarantined, and now she has negative 7 PTO days and she is only going to accrue 5 by the end of the year so she has to “pay” almost a full day of salary to make the balance 0.

That being said, is there anyone here with a strong legal background that can confirm that bars, pools, fitness centers, etc. are exempt from having to close in the U.P.? 

I’m only asking this because there seems to be some confusion amongst my colleagues and I as the language in said EO is very tough for the average person to decipher, and management has not made the call as of yet to close our pool and fitness center which essentially puts us at risk as our hotel is currently chalked full of tourists.

If you were going to these events would you take a COVID test immediately after on Sunday or Monday? I can easily self-quarantine while WFH, everyone in my household will be at these events. Everyone at the events will be late 20's and early 30's.

I will be traveling to the Hennepin county area next week for work from Illinois.  Sales rep so I will be visiting several Big Box Hardware locations.    Question is what is required in Public?   Are masks required in all stores?  Also what are restaurants allowed to do?  Carry-out only, Dine outside or inside?

Also thoughts on overall safety of visiting retail locations.

Masks are required in all stores in Illinois, restaurants are outside dining and only 25% capacity indoors. (too nervous to eat indoors so far)

This could be expensive for childcare providers but departments of health will pay for it to learn what will happen during the school year. This is important data to collect.

What happens when a child care center in Minnesota has a positive case? We send everyone home and keep it quiet.  Families and staff could go get a follow up test on their own, but if the center is closed and no one contacts them there is no reason for the family to self report.

If there is only one positive on the record there is no out break on the record. Kind of a clever trick to cook the books. No official record, no official outbreak.",17,1594824249,minnesota,2020-07-15 10:44:09

CoronavirusMN,fastinserter,White House Coronavirus Task Force Report: Minnesota,"Minnesota in a White House document (that apparently was leaked as it was not officially published) has been put in the ""yellow zone"" category on coronavirus. Almost all states are either ""yellow"" or ""red"" (18 are red). MN starts on page 162 of the report found here:

https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/exclusive-white-house-document-shows-18-states-in-coronavirus-red-zone-covid-19/

The summary for Minnestoa includes

&gt;Minnesota is in the yellow zone for both cases, with 56 new cases per 100,000 population last week, and for test positivity with a rate of Test positivity has risen by with most increases around the Twin Cities area.

&gt;Cases have been gradually rising since mid-June although hospitalizations have not, to date.

&gt;The following three counties had the highest number of new cases over the past 3 weeks: 1. Hennepin County, 2. Ramsey County, and 3. Dakota County. These counties represent 47.1 percent of new cases in Minnesota.

&gt;Minnesota had 56 new cases per 100,000 population in the past week, compared to a national average of 119 per
100,000.

Among the recommendations by the White House Coronavirus Task Force specific to Minnesota:

&gt;Ensure that all business retailers and personal services require masks and can safely social distance. 

&gt;Ensure compliance with current Minnesota StaySafe Plan occupancy restrictions. 

&gt;Consider further limitations on occupancy or closure of certain businesses (bars, restaurants) dependent on changes in local reported cases this week.

&gt;Support local masking requirements that are being instituted and consider a statewide requirement for counties
with rapidly increasing case counts.

Among the recommendation by the Task Force for counties in yellow zone for public officials:

&gt;• Limit gyms to 25% occupancy and close bars until percent positive rates are under 3%; create outdoor dining opportunities with
pedestrian areas

&gt;• Limit social gatherings to 25 people or fewer

&gt;• Institute routine weekly testing of all workers in assisted living and long-term care facilities. Require masks for all staff and prohibit
visitors

&gt;• Ensure that all business retailers and personal services require masks and can safely social distance


And finally, the recommendations by the task force for individuals: 

&gt;• Wear a mask at all times outside the home and maintain physical distance

&gt;• Limit social gatherings to 25 people or fewer

&gt;• Do not go to bars or nightclubs

&gt;• Use take out, outdoor dining or indoor dining when strict social distancing can be maintained

&gt;• Protect anyone with serious medical conditions at home by social distancing at home and using high levels of personal hygiene

&gt;• Reduce your public interactions and activities to 50% of your normal activity

So the question is, will our leaders in Minnesota go with these recommendations? It seems as though the recommendation is to close bars and institute masks, and scale back gatherings to no more than 25 people in one space, *at least* in counties in the ""yellow"" zone and above (28 counties, centered around the localities of MSP, Mankato, Rochester, St. Cloud, Austin, Marshall, Albert Lea, Wothington, Willmar, and New Ulm). 

We do not have anything in the ""red"" zone yet, of which much more stringent recommendations ought be put in place (mask all times outside of home, &lt;10 gatherings, gyms close, etc). I think going with the recommendations now could help stave off having to basically lockdown everything again.",1,1595005777,minnesota,2020-07-17 13:09:37

We also *still* do not have convenience testing, nor do we have testing for asymptomatic people. If you want a test, you can not always get a test. The tests are gate-kept by the big health outfits and require pretty specific symptoms to qualify. It should be noted that many other states do have this. If you want a test in NY or WI, you can get one, regardless of symptoms.

I realize there is a big outbreak in the sun belt and that is impacting supplies, but again, the moonshot testing that everyone pattered on about was supposed to not be dependent on supply limitations.",13,1595108149,minnesota,2020-07-18 17:35:49

CoronavirusMissouri,Kines_Researcher,Help us understand if physical activity and fitness levels influence COVID symptoms (University Research),"Hello everyone,

We (researchers from the University of the Fraser Valley in British Columbia, Canada) are looking for individuals (19+ years of age) who have had COVID-19 and of **any** fitness level to complete an online survey (in english). The survey consists of 3 parts: demographic variables, COVID-19 symptoms, and physical activity/fitness levels prior to being infected. The survey takes about 7-9 minutes to complete.

The aim of our study is to learn if physical activity levels have any influence on the number of symptoms, durations and severity of symptoms, as well as any complications associated with having COVID-19.
